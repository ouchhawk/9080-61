Published: 18 August 2022 As the Global Headquarters of GMP Pharmaceuticals,
Huntingwood site has experienced rapid growth and improvement. Both hardware
and software have been upgraded which ultimately allows Huntingwood site
manufactures more range of products with improved quality. To meet the growing
needs of the production targets, we have built a new Dry Manufacturing
Facility which incorporates a state-of-the-art in-process lab. It allows the
physical characteristic of the products to be verified on-line and ensuring
that every single tablet produced is meeting the product specification. A new
coating machine installed at Huntingwood site allows GMP to produce bigger
batches. In addition, a wet granulation suite provides us with the capability
to make a long list of granulated powders and reform them into granules and
eventually into tablets and sachets. Finally, we have recently been granted
the license from the US FDA for the Food Facility Registration which enables
GMP to produce dietary supplements for the US market. The TGA licence
variation has also been updated with to include Tablet Group (effervescent,
enteric coated, film coated, modified release), Granules Group and Hard
Capsules to our dosage forms. GMP Pharmaceuticals Sponsors CMA Innovation Day

Headquarters Published: 7 February 2022 GMP as a company is always looking for
ways to improve environmental outcomes while also trying to keep a lid on
operational costs. We are aware of the effect that business in general has on
the environment. Fortunately, there are ways we can reduce the greenhouse gas
impacts of production while remaining economically viable. Recently, solar
panels were installed on the roof of GMP Headquarters at Huntingwood. The best
solar power provides a long-term, sustainable solution by minimising our
daytime energy costs which is typically when a great deal of production
occurs. Solar power can also potentially deliver long term cost savings to the
business. Having solar power clearly shows our customers and clients that we
have a strong commitment to the environment. The way of the future is green
and renewable, and GMP endeavours to make changes where possible to meet the
changing needs of our customers and the environment. GMP Pharmaceuticals

of Science for Student Placement Introducing the New Smithfield Warehouse
Published: 7 November 2021 GMP Pharmaceuticals recently acquired a new
warehouse/distribution centre located in the suburb of Smithfield, a short
drive from both the Girraween and Huntingwood sites. The acquisition reflects
GMP’s growing business and the need for diverse operating and storage
solutions to cope with the increasing demand, particularly from our VIP
customers. The site consists of two separated warehouse buildings (Warehouse A
& B) with huge breezeway in between the buildings. Its modern design and user-
friendly layout will keep workflow moving efficiently and safely. In the
larger building Warehouse A, GMP will be able to keep up to 6 weeks of safety
stock for important and popular ingredients. This means that when a VIP comes
to us with a large order, we will be able to transfer the material to both the
Girraween and Huntingwood sites production areas with speed and efficiency.
Currently we are rearranging the current established racks to configurate to
‘double-deep’ to maximise rack space aiming to have 5,400 pallet spaces. Once
upon its completion, we will review the space requirements for future growth
and set up more pallets racks which could create an additional 6,500 pallet
spaces. The smaller building Warehouse B will be utilised to store up to 3,800
pallets of finished products. By keeping a store of popular, fast-moving
products, this will also enable GMP to supply clients swiftly. GMP will be
kept in a state of smooth productivity, keeping our customers happy and
satisfied with a finished product without delays. GMP-owned prime movers and
trailers will be on the move consistently, transferring required materials to
both Girraween and Huntingwood. GMP Pharmaceuticals Sponsors CMA Innovation

signs exclusive probiotics supply agreement with leading dairy producer
Fonterra Published: 26 July 2020 GMP is proud to announce that we have signed
an exclusive supply agreement with Fonterra, a leading multinational dairy
producer based in New Zealand. With a long history in dairy, Fonterra has
harnessed their global dairy expertise and local to knowledge to become one of
New Zealand’s largest companies and accounts for approximately 30% of the
world’s dairy exports. Their brands have become synonymous with exceptional
quality that has been trusted for generations. Through this partnership, GMP
has gained exclusive supply in Australia over Fonterra’s 2 clinically tested
probiotic strains for infants – Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus HN001 (marketed
as NZMP SureStart LactoB HN001) and Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis
HN019 (marketed as NZMP SureStart BifidoB HN019).These can be used in formulas
for children under 12 years old and for pregnant or expecting mothers. The
immune system is key to good health across our entire lifespan and is critical
to maintaining the overall healthy functioning of our bodies. Probiotics are
recognised as a simple, effective way to help support a strong immune system
as more than half of the immune system’s white blood cells are in the gut.
With the current global situation, there is now an intense and widespread
focus on the importance of a healthy immune system and how to support it, and
awareness around the specific benefits of specific probiotic strains is now on
the rise. HN001 and HN019 functions: 1\. Good for intestinal health and
regulates intestinal microbiota. Can be used to optimise the composition and
activity of intestinal microbiota to treat a range of diseases or reduce the
risk of infections. 2\. Enhance natural and acquired immunity, which can
result in increased resistance to infection and disease. 3\. Helps to reduce
inflammation and may even play a role in healthy brain development. 4\. Helps
to reduce the risk of developing immune disorders such as allergies. 5\. Can
reduce the symptoms of immune disorders such as atopic dermatitis and
infantile eczema. The HN001 and HN019 strains have shown a long history of
excellent stability and safety in foods. Through gaining exclusive supply of
these strains in Australia, GMP can achieve and maintain the highest quality
in health food products that are easy for the consumer to store and use. GMP
is always looking for innovation in the health food industry and we are very
excited about our new partnership. We look forward to seeing these two amazing
strains in products across the TGA, GB and food categories. GMP

Pharmaceuticals 25th Year Anniversary and Opening of Headquarters Published: 1
October 2019 In October 2019 another important milestone of GMP
Pharmaceuticals was reached. GMP celebrated its 25th Anniversary as well as
the grand opening of our new, state of the art Huntingwood HQ. The company has
come a long way over 25 years, and in recent years GMP had seen a rapid
expansion due to the high demand of our quality products. Many were invited
and attended our Ceremony including media, suppliers, customers and relevant
VIPs in our industry. The opening ceremony started by acknowledging the Darug
People as the traditional custodians of the land on which we hold the
ceremony. GMP acknowledges and respects their continuing culture and the
contribution they make to the life of this city and this region. Deputy Mayor,
Councillor Tony Bleasdale, was our first honourable guest speaker.
Acknowledging the importance of the contribution of GMP in the growth of
employment and economy in the Western Sydney area, Mr. Bleasdale also stressed
on the importance of the multi-cultural aspect in the area where GMP is
encouraged to continuously work on. Mark Goodsell from the Australian Industry
Group, was our next guest speaker. He understood the important role of the
pharmaceutical industry in the economy as it is booming due to the popularity
and good quality of Australian manufacturing. He paid tribute on how GMP
contributed to the growth of the industry and consistency of producing top
quality products in the past 25 years. Director Karl Ye and COO Daniel Xu also
had messages to pass onto our guests. Karl spoke of the past, the origins of
GMP, his journey to success and all the friends we have made along the way as
a company. Daniel spoke of the future of GMP, our goals and our successes to
come. Together all of our guest speakers painted a picture of a company that
is stable, successful and growing, a fantastic and positive outlook for the
future of GMP Pharmaceuticals. The GMP Pharmaceuticals 25th anniversary and
grand opening ceremony was a great day in the history of the GMP. It was a
proud day for GMP and we sincerely appreciated our guests and employees for
celebrating with us. The growth and success of GMP is a tribute to our
customers, our suppliers and our people. We look forward to many more years of
success. GMP Pharmaceuticals Sponsors CMA Innovation Day Networking Drinks 26

During April 2019 GMP Pharmaceuticals hosted engineers from different
companies including Changsung and Smart Corporation. Our maintenance and
engineering teams along with the engineers from overseas worked together to
set up new machines in the Dairy and Packaging department. The work involved
in setting up the new machines was very intense involving long hours and tight
schedules. Setting up the new machines is vital in ensuring continued growth
of GMP, and increases in production and quality. Indeed the addition of the
new Packaging machines led to increased productivity and capacity in a short
period of time. To maintain output more staff, more shifts and more efficient
systems were put in place organised by strong leadership growing within the
production areas, with many employees rising to the challenge of increased
production. GMP Pharmaceuticals Sponsors CMA Innovation Day Networking Drinks

Placement GMP signs exclusive probiotics supply agreement with leading dairy
producer Fonterra Published: 26 July 2020 GMP is proud to announce that we
have signed an exclusive supply agreement with Fonterra, a leading
multinational dairy producer based in New Zealand. With a long history in
dairy, Fonterra has harnessed their global dairy expertise and local to
knowledge to become one of New Zealand’s largest companies and accounts for
approximately 30% of the world’s dairy exports. Their brands have become
synonymous with exceptional quality that has been trusted for generations.
Through this partnership, GMP has gained exclusive supply in Australia over
Fonterra’s 2 clinically tested probiotic strains for infants –
Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus HN001 (marketed as NZMP SureStart LactoB HN001)
and Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis HN019 (marketed as NZMP
SureStart BifidoB HN019).These can be used in formulas for children under 12
years old and for pregnant or expecting mothers. The immune system is key to
good health across our entire lifespan and is critical to maintaining the
overall healthy functioning of our bodies. Probiotics are recognised as a
simple, effective way to help support a strong immune system as more than half
of the immune system’s white blood cells are in the gut. With the current
global situation, there is now an intense and widespread focus on the
importance of a healthy immune system and how to support it, and awareness
around the specific benefits of specific probiotic strains is now on the rise.
HN001 and HN019 functions: 1\. Good for intestinal health and regulates
intestinal microbiota. Can be used to optimise the composition and activity of
intestinal microbiota to treat a range of diseases or reduce the risk of
infections. 2\. Enhance natural and acquired immunity, which can result in
increased resistance to infection and disease. 3\. Helps to reduce
inflammation and may even play a role in healthy brain development. 4\. Helps
to reduce the risk of developing immune disorders such as allergies. 5\.
Remarkable reduction effect on the atopic dermatitis, children eczema. The
HN001 and HN019 strains have shown a long history of excellent stability and
safety in foods. Through gaining exclusive supply of these strains in
Australia, GMP can achieve and maintain the highest quality in health food
products that are easy for the consumer to store and use. GMP is always
looking for innovation in the health food industry and we are very excited
about our new partnership. We look forward to seeing these two amazing strains
in products across the TGA, GB and food categories. GMP signs exclusive

November 2016 Date: 25/11/20 On 24th November 2016, the winners of the New
Zealand International Business Awards were announced at a black-tie ceremony
at Auckland’s SKYCITY Convention Centre. In attendance was Prime Minister John

hundred of exceptional leaders from different industries. GMP Diary General

in Operations and Supply Chain Award”. This award recognises innovative

manufacturing, collaboration with partners, customer service or other aspects
of the business model employed to maximise success in international markets.

NZTE’s chief executive Peter Chrisp said the awards celebrate the innovation
and a can-do attitude among business leaders. “After a long period of
liberalisation of New Zealands economy, only those companies that are
internationally competitive will survive over the long term. Almost by
definition, if they are here and succeeding then they have found an
international niche within which they can compete” Chrisp said. NZTE’s chief
executive Peter Chrisp. Photo / supplied The judges were impressed by GMP’s
innovation and continued improvement over the years. “GMP has continued to
improve year on year. An innovative approach to their business model and their
willingness to make significant investments in quality control and
traceability is a credit to their long-term perspective.” – NZIBA judges. In
fact, this is the second New Zealand International Business Award GMP has won
over the years. GMP was also the winner of ‘Most Innovative Approach’ award in
2010, and for the 3rd year in a row GMP Pharmaceuticals Group has been proudly
nominated finalist every year for Excellence in Innovation, Operation & Supply
Chain and also Best Large Business Award. Winning the award is a new milestone
for GMP. It not only means our quality and supply chain management system has

Seamless Quality Protection Logistic System Launching Ceremony Published: 14
December 2015 On the 10th December 2015, Evergrande GMP Dairy proudly launched
its “Cowala Seamless Quality Protection Logistic System” at its state of the
art new logistic centre in East Tamaki, Auckland.We were honored to have MP Mr
Stuart Smith (Member of Social Service Committee, Deputy Chairperson of
Primary Production Committee) & MP Mr Jamie-Lee Ross (Member of Foreign
Affairs, Defense & Trade Committee and Chairperson of Parliamentary Service
Commission Precincts Committee), CCIC, China Shipping NZ and various VIPs &
guests join us on the day to share this special occasion. Mr Stuart Smith had
especially flown from Wellington to Auckland to attend the event. In the past
year, Evergrande GMP has grown at a rapid speed. Since November 2014,
Evergrande GMP has exported around 3 million cans (450 TEU) of its Cowala 900g
infant & adult formula to North Asia including China and Korea. Cowala milk
powders are not only consumed by around 80 thousand families in China; Cowala
infant formula has also become one of the top selling New Zealand infant
formula brands in Korea’s high-end supermarkets. Evergrande GMP Dairy upholds
the “Quality Above All” belief and implements the highest pharmaceutical
standards for production management, which means that rapid development of
production scale is matched by acceleration in product quality and product
safety. With excellent product quality and its good reputation established by
consumers’ word of mouth endorsement, Cowala has been voted as “China’s most
influential infant formula brand 2015” on China’s Sina network, it has also
won “2015 Mummy’s most recommended imported infant formulas 2015”, a survey
which was participated in and voted by thousands of mothers in China.
Evergrande GMP’s Seamless Quality Protection Logistic System Evergrande GMP’s
logistic system provides the best assurance possible that the quality of our
product is maintained without compromise during its long journey from the Land
of the Long White Cloud, all the way to ports in China. It is a Seamless
Quality Protection System because at every step of the way, at every product
movement, every storage location, risks to product quality have been assessed
and we have taken appropriate measures to eliminate or minimize those risks.
There are no gaps in the process, no missing links in the chain and product
quality is protected at each movement and at each storage point. All GMP’s
products are manufactured in accordance with the Risk Management Program
pertaining to that site and meet all quality parameters under that RMP. GMP’s
containerization step is especially unique and innovative. GMP’s warehouse has
a fully enclosed indoor area where we can position and load 8 40ft containers
at once, in a fully secure environment, 100% protected from the weather. GMP
maintains an excellent relationship with shipping partners and has in place
agreements whereby our containers are loaded onto container ships at or below
the water line. This ensures containers are placed where they are most
protected from temperature extremes which could affect the temperature-
sensitive vitamins and essential fats and oils in baby formula. As an extra
assurance, every container carries a temperature data logger, which
continuously records the inside temperature. This data is collected at the end
of the journey and checked to confirm that the travel conditions met our
requirements and expectations. Having arrived at one of the ports in China,
our local team takes care of the product, so it again returns to our control.
It is moved to bonded warehouses while it awaits CIQ clearance. These storage
facilities are monitored for temperature and are kept as cool as possible.
Evergrande GMP’s Seamless Quality Protection Logistic System At time of
manufacture, each and every can of Cowala product is batch coded with the
usual information (Batch, Date of Manufacture, and Best Before) and in
addition to this, each can receives its own unique 2D QR code – no two cans
will ever have the same QR code. This is part of our patented “Black Box”
system with which are able to link product information, raw material
information, testing results, foreign matter detection images, and (in the
unlikely event that we should we ever need it) recall information, to each
individual can. Anyone with the appropriate app on their smart phone can scan
the QR code and will be directed to the website where are the relevant
information is accessible. The 2D code of each can is recorded as it passes
along the production line and for the 6 cans in each shipper, there is a 2D
code printed, denoting the 6 cans inside. At time of distribution, the code on
the shipper can be scanned and the information is now available of which
particular cans are being sent to which destination. GMP signs exclusive

in New Zealand as an infant formula manufacturing company which is very
focused on the quality of our products, our quality control systems, and our
strict adherence to food safety regulations. At GMP Dairy we continually
strive to deliver only the highest quality products for our consumers, as
babies are the most delicate “consumers” of all. On 13th November 2015,
Evergrande GMP Dairy, ably assisted by New Zealand Food Safety Minister Hon Jo
Goodhew, Botany MP Jami-Lee Ross, China Trade Commissioner Mr Zhang Fan and
Evergrande Agri-Husbandry Group Chairman Mr Xu Wen, officially launched the
“New Zealand Food Safety College” at its state of the art head office in East

above all”. To support this philosophy and in order to emphasise to our
employees and business partners the importance of food safety, Evergrande GMP
Dairy has established the “New Zealand Food Safety College” to provide food
safety training courses to help our distributors, employees and business
partners understand New Zealand and International food safety programs and
systems. Here at Evergrande GMP Dairy, our philosophy is “Quality above all”.

Faculty of Science for Student Placement NZ infant formula making a comeback
in China Published: 23 September 2015 Evergrande Dairy has sold two million
cans of Cowala branded infant formula in China; it aims to double sales this
year. Evergrande Dairy Group general manager Yu Wei Ming says this shows NZ
infant formula is making a comeback in China after Fonterra’s false botulism
scare two years ago. It also proves infant formula made in NZ still resonates
well with Chinese consumers, he says. Ming was in Auckland recently to attend
a Cowala charity event: for every can of Cowala sold in China, Evergrande is
donating 10c to the Foundation of Youth Development in NZ. Evergrande hopes to
make Cowala a top infant formula brand in China. Ming says the100% NZ product
is the main reason for Cowala’s early success. NZ infant formula’s reputation
in China took a hit after Fonterra’s false botulism scare in 2013. This
allowed infant formula makers in Europe to steal our market share. Ming says
competition remains strong but the NZ brand is making a comeback. “After the
crisis, NZ branded infant formula sales dropped a little,” he told Rural News.
“But each year we have millions of new babies and new mothers and there is new
awareness about NZ infant formula. “We are gradually seeing NZ products
getting back and in the next two-three years NZ products will get back on the
right track.” Evergrande markets its Cowala infant formula as 100% from NZ and
the best in the world. He notes that Cowala’s first year sales form a small
proportion of the total infant formula sales in China. “We are focussing on
lifting sales and targeting to double sales this year; tripling sales will be
even better.” Evergrande Dairy owns 51% of GMP Dairy, a South Auckland infant
formula maker among the first to get new accreditation from Chinese
authorities. GMP Dairy managing director Karl Ye says the company has received
great support in NZ over the last 14 years. “It’s now time to pay back to the
community for the support,” he says. The ‘Cowala 10c of Love’ charity was
launched to coincide with the mid-autumn moon festival in China. Evergrande
and GMP were a big sponsor of a charity auction night for children with
autism, held in June by Young Business Women in NZ. Evergrande Dairy is part
of the Evergrande Group, which started in real estate and has since
diversified into other businesses including fast moving consumer goods. Cowala
infant formula’s claimed point of difference is its world-first patented
traceability via the cans: this allows consumers to use their smartphone to
scan a barcode telling them the milk powder’s history and shows an x-ray
picture of the contents. Shipping information on each can helps streamline
access at the Chinese border. GMP signs exclusive probiotics supply agreement

nominated as Finalist for 2015 New Zealand International Business Awards
Published: 26 March 2015 GMP was proudly nominated as the finalist for three
awards for NZTE International Business awards. GMP nominated as Finalist for
2015 New Zealand International Business Awards Date: 26 March 2015 GMP was
proudly nominated as the finalist for three awards for NZTE International
Business awards. ogni Celebrating the passion, vision and new approaches that
New Zealand businesses are taking to achieve international success, the Awards
are run by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) and its Strategic Partner
ANZ. NZTE is the Government’s international business development agency,
helping to boost global reach and build capability so our companies can grow
bigger, better, faster. They leverage their connections and government
influence on behalf of businesses, and apply local knowledge. The New Zealand
International Business Awards are organised by NZTE, it is one of the biggest
business awards in the year. This award is considered to be extremely
authoritative and have been running since 2009. The purpose of the award is to
celebrate New Zealand business success in the world and recognise professional
excellence and innovative practice. They provide an opportunity for New
Zealand businesses to benchmark performance, build capability and boost
employee morale. Therefore, GMP was extremely honored to have been nominated
as one of the finalists, competing with some of the top enterprises in New
Zealand. Our General Manager, Ravinesh Kumaran was presented the finalist
certificates for 3 categories on 13th March in a breakfast hosted by NZTE at
the Better by Design CEO Summit held at Villa Maria. GMP was nominated as
finalist for three awards we have applied: ANZ Best Business Operating
Internationally – Over $50m Award Excellence in Innovation Award Excellence in
Operations Award Peter Chrisp, Chief Executive of NZTE, said the diversity
exemplifies an increased appetite from businesses to push frontiers and
embrace innovation. “In this year’s finalists we can see companies who are
going premium with new business models and who are leveraging the New Zealand
brand. They’re building businesses that are offering more tailored and bespoke
products and services and the results are evident in their success.” David
Green, Managing Director Institutional at ANZ New Zealand, said: “The great
diversity of this year’s finalists reflects the significant potential for New
Zealand businesses when they take the time to understand offshore markets,
pursue new growth opportunities and innovate to develop products that meet the
needs of end-consumers. Their success is contributing to New Zealand’s growing
achievements in doing business globally, which is supporting job creation,
economic growth and a stronger future.” GMP was the winner of ‘Most Innovative
Approach’ award in 2010. The company has shown incredible growth since its
inception, applying ingenuity to business process and growth strategy. High
standards of quality, increased customer support and growth has enabled
recognition from numerous government bodies, industry bodies and business
associations leading to numerous awards. Over the years the company has been
conferred with a number of business excellence awards and recognition for
significant contribution to the natural products industry and manufacturing
sector. We believe GMP has become a key player in the industry and
demonstrated to other New Zealand companies, that small companies with no
large corporate type international backings can still be successful if they
persevere and work hard. Our motto is “To work harder for your success” and we
strongly believe that this culture is important for success. Our success has
emanated into multiple business awards and business introductions to some of
the largest public and state owned companies in China. In addition, we have
had multiple visits from parliament members, prime minister, Trade Minister
Fonterra and other high profile people from New Zealand and China that have
shown interest in the GMP story. We believe that we are significant
contributors to the Nutraceutical and Infant Formula industry and our
pharmaceutical background gives that advantage. Our winning formula is putting
food safety as the foundation of our business and aim for perfection in every
aspect of production. We aim to deliver only the best to the consumers. GMP is
very proud to be an Olympic partner of the NZOC and New Zealand Olympic Team
and wish the team every success for the upcoming Olympic Games in Rio. GMP

Placement GMP 和乳制品领先品牌Fonterra签订益生菌独家代理协议 Published: 26 July 2020
GMP自豪地宣布，我们已与新西兰一家领先的跨国乳制品生产商签署了独家代理协议。Fonterra拥有悠久的乳制品制造历史、全球和本地乳制品制造经验，是新西兰最大的公司之一，约占全球乳制品出口的30％。他们的品牌已成为世代以来信赖的卓越品质的代名词。
GMP在澳大利亚已获得Fonterra两种经临床测试的婴儿益生菌菌株的独家供应-鼠李糖乳杆菌HN001（以NZMP SureStart LactoB
HN001上市）和动物双歧杆菌亚种His（以NZMP SureStart BifidoB HN019上市），用于12岁以下儿童配方奶粉，也适合孕妇或准妈妈。
免疫系统是我们整个生命周期中良好健康的关键，对于维持我们身体的整体健康功能至关重要。益生菌被认为是支持强大免疫系统的一种简单有效的方法，因为一半以上的免疫系统白细胞都在肠道中。在当前的全球形势下，现在人们对健康的免疫系统的重要性及其支持方法的关注日益广泛，并且对特定益生菌菌株的特定益处的认识也正在提高。
HN001和HN019功能： 1.有益于肠道健康并调节肠道菌群。可用于优化肠道菌群的组成和活性，以治疗多种疾病或降低感染风险。
2.增强自然和获得的免疫力，这可能导致对感染和疾病的抵抗力增强。 3.帮助减少炎症，甚至可能在健康的大脑发育中起作用。
4.有助于降低发生免疫性疾病（例如过敏症）的风险。 5.对异位性皮炎，儿童湿疹有明显的减轻作用。
HN001和HN019菌株已在食品中显示出极好的稳定性和安全性的悠久历史。通过在澳大利亚获得这些菌株的独家供应，GMP可以达到并保持最易于消费者存储和使用的保健食品的最高质量标准。
GMP一直在寻找健康食品行业的创新，我们对新的合作伙伴关系感到非常兴奋。我们期待在TGA，GB和食品的益生菌产品的食品类别中看到这两种有价值的菌株。 GMP

GMP集团获得2016年新西兰最佳国际商业大奖 Published: 27 March 2020 GMP集团赢得2016年NZIBA的获胜者
上周，由新西兰总理John Key ，经济部长Steve Joyce, 新西兰贸发委 NZTE主席 Peter
Chrisp首席执行官和来自不同行业的数百名商业精英在奥克兰的SKYCITY会议中心共同参加本次盛大的颁奖典礼，宣布新西兰国际商业奖的获奖者。GMP制药集团很光荣的赢得了“2016年最佳运营和供应链优秀奖”。这一奖项表彰的重点在于贸易进出口、国际货物运输、制造、与合作伙伴良好的协作，客户服务和其他方面的业务模式领域的运营和供应链管理有着出众的创新模式，以最大限度的在国际市场上取得成功。
GMP乳业集团总经理 Ravinesh Kumaran GMP Pharmaceuticals Group was awarded the “2016
Excellence in Operations and Supply Chain Award”. This award recognises
innovative approaches to operations and supply chain management in areas such
as procurement and sourcing, international transportation of goods,
manufacturing, collaboration with partners, customer service or other aspects
of the business model employed to maximise success in international markets.
这个奖项到迄今为止已有50周年的历史，由新西兰贸易与战略合作伙伴企业ANZ共同合作举办，该奖项旨在表扬和认可新西兰优秀企业在世界舞台上获得的成功。

Development Hon Steve Joyce Photo/ Supplied NZTE的首席执行官Peter
Chrisp表示，这次奖项的宗旨在于表扬企业领导者的创新精神和做事态度。
Chrisp说过：“在新西兰经济长期自由化之后，只有那些具有国际竞争力的企业才能长期生存，几乎可以确定的是，如果他们在这里能取得成功，他们就能找到一个能够相互竞争的国际市场。”
NZTE的首席执行官彼得Chrisp 评委们对GMP的创新和多年来的持续进步印象非常深刻。
NZIBA评委表示：“GMP一直在不断进步，他们的商业模式极具创新，在对产品的质量控制和可追溯性从长远的角度来说他们愿意作出持续重大的投资和管理。”
事实上，这是GMP多年来赢得的第二个新西兰大型国际商业奖。早在2010年时，GMP成功的获得了“企业最具创新奖”，接着连续三年GMP集团每年都被成功的提名入围最佳商业运营供应奖和年度最佳大型企业奖，并且GMP集团从1994年成立以来总共获得澳洲和新西兰“最佳企业商业大奖”22次。
获奖是GMP一个新的里程碑，这不仅意味着GMP的质量和供应链管理体系得到了评委的认可。更重要的是也证明了GMP获得新西兰政府和商界的极度认可和高度重视。
GMP在促进进出口和国际贸易中发挥着重要作用，对新西兰经济的发展起着不可磨灭的贡献。 Group Photo of All NZIBA 2016

Language: EN EN 中文 Partnership with the University of Sydney Faculty of
Science for Student Placement High-tech canning line opened Published: 8
August 2014 Source : FWplus: Font size PrintShare High-tech canning line
opened Author :Hugh Stringleman Date :8 August 2014 GMP Dairy principal Karl
Ye, left, and plant manager Stelios Simpson show off the components of new
product-safety systems at the opening of a new infant formula canning line in
Auckland. Added-value infant formula exports from New Zealand received a boost
last week with the opening of a second canning line at GMP Dairy’s plant in
East Tamaki, Auckland. Trade Minister Tim Groser opened the plant expansion
for GMP principal Karl Ye, who also revealed new tracing technologies for
individual cans of infant formula that would provide added reassurance for
Chinese parents. GMP Dairy, a division of GMP Pharmaceuticals, was formed in
2009 and is a contract packer for a majority of the NZ infant formula brands
targeting the huge Chinese market. It was among the first NZ plants to receive
Chinese accreditation from May 1 and received favourable comments about its
pharmaceutical parentage and premises, which fits the Chinese desire to
regulate the sale of infant formula. GMP said the East Tamaki plant was the
first and largest pharmaceutical grade dairy manufacturing facility in NZ. Ye
said the second canning line would raise plant capacity to 40 million cans a
year, containing 40,000 tonnes of milk powder and ingredients. NZ’s exports of
retail-ready infant formula cans are worth more than $200m a year and GMP said
it expected to pack about 40% of that trade. The plant takes base infant
formula powder from Fonterra, Westland, and Synlait and adds specialised
ingredients to the brand owners’ specifications before canning and labelling.
Assistant operations manager Stelios Simpson said two new technologies had
been added to the packing line for tracing security and consumer reassurance.
The first was a “black box” to capture images from CCTV cameras, sensors,
batch readers and xrays at stages of production to store information and data
in a safe location resistant to fire and earthquakes. The second was
smartphone integrated storage of can images and data through a unique QR code
accessible from the retail locations by consumers before purchase. For
example, xrays taken of the sealed can would assure consumers there was no
metal contamination. GMP Dairy said while that might seem overkill to NZ
consumers, Chinese parents would be very interested. The QR code also provided
phones with ingredient lists and guarded against product faking. The new
production line also used robotic systems to reduce labour and prevent
contamination through minimising human error and interference. GMP Dairy said
it was the only company out of the 13 NZ infant formula plants to be

NZ About Services All Services Research & Development Regulatory Manufacturing

New Zealand Language: EN EN 中文 Partnership with the University of Sydney
Faculty of Science for Student Placement Media Article: Trace technology set
to add value to milk Published: 3 August 2014 Farmer: Trace technology set to
add value to milk When Chinese-born Karl Ye emigrated to Australia in the
early 1990s he needed to get a job to support his young child and his wife,
who was studying for a PHD in public health at a Sydney university. Within two
years he had started his own company – essentially being the middleman
sourcing natural products in Australia, such a bee pollen, and exporting them
to Asian markets. Twenty years on New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser will
officiate on Tuesday at an Auckland function where Ye is opening a second
canning line for his infant formula manufacturing company, GMP Dairy. His
group, GMP Pharmaceuticals. now has three plants in Australia and New Zealand
manufacturing infant formula, health supplements and nutraceuticals. and
another company, Aunew, providing a one-stop shop to small to medium
businesses wanting to export into China and soon into Malaysia as well. At the
official event this week, Ye will also unveil what he says is world-first
patented traceability technology on the infant formula cans that allows
consumers to use their smartphones to scan a barcode telling them the milk
powder’s history and even includes an X-ray picture of the contents. Although
this may seem like overkill to Kiwi consumers, Ye says it is not in China,
where food safety was a key issue for shoppers, particularly for infant milk
powder following the melamine scandals. The technology could be used on other
products, he says. GMP has already patented a black box for infant formula
processing that monitors and stores information on the production process.
Ye’s big on adding value – it is the business model behind GMP. He said the
model is to source low-value natural ingredients from New Zealand and
Australia and add value through world-class manufacturing and technology, and
then use his connections and cultural nous to export them to Asia. His company
grew in the early days by advertising in local newspapers for migrants who had
contacts in their home market for his exports. He still employs many migrants,
claiming they are an untapped resource of expertise many other Kiwi and
Australian employers shun because of cultural differences. He says patience is
the main ingredient needed in China, where negotiations tend to take years.
That’s one of the reasons he started Aunew in 2005, expanding the operations
GMP had established for itself in Asian markets to help other smaller
companies do the same. About 60 Australian and New Zealand companies have so
far utilised the services. One of the key things they do is simply repackaging
the product to appeal to Asian audiences who often want better packaging to
give the products as gifts. Born in Northern China and one of three boys, Ye
got a masters degree in international economics at Wuhan University then
headed to Australia. After establishing GMP there, Ye thought his value-add
business model would work equally well in New Zealand. He lived here for three
years from 2002 setting up a plant in East Tamaki. His second New Zealand
plant, GMP Dairy, opened in 2009 due to increased demand in China for infant
formula and was the first Kiwi manufacturer to be registered by the Chinese
government under new rules introduced this year to lift quality and safety.
GMP said it hoped to generate NZ$70 to $80 million revenue over the next two
years from infant formula exports. Ye says the company’s second canning line
will allow it to proceess 40 million tonnes of milk powder a year, or 400
million cans a year under its own brands and those of others it contract
manufactures for. That’s a lot of room for growth, but Ye is a man who likes
to think big. His aim to be the world’s leading manufacturing partner for
premium nutritional products from Australasia. He must be doing something
right – GMP has more than 350 customers, employs 250 people, exports 55 per
cent of turnover, and Ye is talking to potential investors for capital to
further expand the company’s production and warehousing capability. GMP signs

Region: New Zealand Australia New Zealand Language: EN EN 中文 Partnership with
the University of Sydney Faculty of Science for Student Placement Ogni organic
milk powder getting into one of the largest supermarket in China Published: 10
July 2014 Recently, New Zealand Organic Milk Ltd has achieved a new milestone.
Ogni as one of the top New Zealand organic milk powder brands, has been
successfully launched and entered the boutique stores of China Resources
Vanguard Co Ltd. CR Vanguard is one of the largest franchise supermarkets in
China. Till today, Ogni has been sold in a number of boutique shops in various
countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, China and more. New
Zealand Organic Milk Ltd (NZOM) has also become the only organic milk powder
manufacturer in New Zealand to establish this achievement. Organic foods are
produced the way nature intended and without the use of antibiotics, synthetic
fertilizers and pesticides. With Chinese consumers becoming more aware of the
importance of food safety and are more familiar with the nature and benefits
of organic products, organic foods are becoming a fashion in China. However,
the Chinese government are starting to tighten the requirements on importing
organic foods. There is a very strict set of rules for overseas dairy products
getting into Australia and China. Every batch of dairy products has to be
randomly inspected. The representative of NZOM highlighted that one of the
main reason which contributed to Ogni’s success is the experience the company
has for pharmaceutical products. NZOM as subsidiary of GMP Pharmaceuticals
Group has over 20 years experience in the pharmaceuticals industry and has a
well developed quality control system. Also, NZOM is the only New Zealand
dairy manufacturer who has achieved the GMP certificate. These reasons answer
the question of why Ogni is able to entre mainstream supermarkets in China
under such rigid regulations. Over years of research, NZOM has developed
unique formulations of Ogni nutritional organic milk powders for pregnant
women, the mid-aged, children, students, ladies as well as lactating women
etc. The variety and high quality of these products enables Ogni to become one
of the most reputable organic milk powder brands in the market. This has also
attracted NZTE to assist the company to promote and further develop this brand
in the global market. GMP signs exclusive probiotics supply agreement with

SPONSORING STUDENTS ASSOCIATION FOR CULTURE EXPLORATION Published: 12 June
2014 GMP Pharmaceuticals’ primary proudly sponsored the Auckland Chinese
Students and Scholars Association for a four-day trip in June 2014. The
students were taken to Ohope, Te Maungarongo Marae, Bay of Plenty and many
other attractive places The students commented on the beautiful beaches which
were covered in shells and that this was the first time that they had seen
them; a number of them played rugby for the first time; and they learnt about
Maori art forms and Maori traditions for the first time. The students said
this event brought them wonderful and unforgettable memories. GMP worked
alongside the Consulate-General of The People’s Republic of China in Auckland
to enhance cross-cultural communication and to share knowledge for Chinese
students in New Zealand. The Maori and Kiwi culture exploration gives
international students more chance to interact with the local communities and
helps enrich their life experience overseas. GMP hopes to contribute to
education development between New Zealand and other countries and repaying the
society by sponsoring such events. GMP signs exclusive probiotics supply

Placement GMP 和乳制品领先品牌Fonterra签订益生菌独家代理协议 Published: 26 July 2020
GMP自豪地宣布，我们已与新西兰一家领先的跨国乳制品生产商签署了独家代理协议。Fonterra拥有悠久的乳制品制造历史、全球和本地乳制品制造经验，是新西兰最大的公司之一，约占全球乳制品出口的30％。他们的品牌已成为世代以来信赖的卓越品质的代名词。
GMP在澳大利亚已获得Fonterra两种经临床测试的婴儿益生菌菌株的独家供应-鼠李糖乳杆菌HN001（以NZMP SureStart LactoB
HN001上市）和动物双歧杆菌亚种His（以NZMP SureStart BifidoB HN019上市），用于12岁以下儿童配方奶粉，也适合孕妇或准妈妈。
免疫系统是我们整个生命周期中良好健康的关键，对于维持我们身体的整体健康功能至关重要。益生菌被认为是支持强大免疫系统的一种简单有效的方法，因为一半以上的免疫系统白细胞都在肠道中。在当前的全球形势下，现在人们对健康的免疫系统的重要性及其支持方法的关注日益广泛，并且对特定益生菌菌株的特定益处的认识也正在提高。
HN001和HN019功能： 1.有益于肠道健康并调节肠道菌群。可用于优化肠道菌群的组成和活性，以治疗多种疾病或降低感染风险。
2.增强自然和获得的免疫力，这可能导致对感染和疾病的抵抗力增强。 3.帮助减少炎症，甚至可能在健康的大脑发育中起作用。
4.有助于降低发生免疫性疾病（例如过敏症）的风险。 5.对异位性皮炎，儿童湿疹有明显的减轻作用。
HN001和HN019菌株已在食品中显示出极好的稳定性和安全性的悠久历史。通过在澳大利亚获得这些菌株的独家供应，GMP可以达到并保持最易于消费者存储和使用的保健食品的最高质量标准。
GMP一直在寻找健康食品行业的创新，我们对新的合作伙伴关系感到非常兴奋。我们期待在TGA，GB和食品的益生菌产品的食品类别中看到这两种有价值的菌株。 GMP

Chrisp表示，这次奖项的宗旨在于表扬企业领导者的创新精神和做事态度。
Chrisp说过：“在新西兰经济长期自由化之后，只有那些具有国际竞争力的企业才能长期生存，几乎可以确定的是，如果他们在这里能取得成功，他们就能找到一个能够相互竞争的国际市场。”
NZTE的首席执行官彼得Chrisp 评委们对GMP的创新和多年来的持续进步印象非常深刻。
NZIBA评委表示：“GMP一直在不断进步，他们的商业模式极具创新，在对产品的质量控制和可追溯性从长远的角度来说他们愿意作出持续重大的投资和管理。”
事实上，这是GMP多年来赢得的第二个新西兰大型国际商业奖。早在2010年时，GMP成功的获得了“企业最具创新奖”，接着连续三年GMP集团每年都被成功的提名入围最佳商业运营供应奖和年度最佳大型企业奖，并且GMP集团从1994年成立以来总共获得澳洲和新西兰“最佳企业商业大奖”22次。
获奖是GMP一个新的里程碑，这不仅意味着GMP的质量和供应链管理体系得到了评委的认可。更重要的是也证明了GMP获得新西兰政府和商界的极度认可和高度重视。
