https://clinchoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Staff-Augmentation-Case-Study.pdf
Formerly FMD K&L Implementing FSP  Staff Augmentation  for a Pharma ClientCASE STUDY2 Managing a large team can be challenging. A sudden change of team size, whether itâs a scale-up or  scale-down, can present serious questions on how to digest the off-boarding resources in a downsize  situation or how to ramp up resources quickly in the case of a scale-up. This requires management  experience and constant, transparent communication between the sponsor and our management team. The ClinChoice ProcessHR Recruiting Support Dedicated Account Manager Team Structure and DesignPlanning, Communication, and EvaluationCollaboration with Our Clients RetentionFor one top-10 pharmaceutical company, we   provide a mixed model that includes the following: Staff augmentation  in biostatistics  and statistical  programming for their  existing in-house team.Dedicated FSP teams  working on specific  projects to build  efficiency in both  timelines and cost.Traditional large FSP  team that covers all  functional areas within  their organization.3 We keep our recruiting team updated on the lookout for programmers in general and some specialties,  knowing our clientsâ profiles. We developed a database of specialty programmers we can access when  finding a solution for our clients. To better build our network in this regard, we opened new offices in  different global areas, established new collaborations with global partners, and teamed up with other  CROs to share resource information. A dedicated account manager is appointed to be the point of contact (POC) for the client. ClinChoice  account managers have long tenures in the pharmaceutical industry and extensive experience working  with clients in project- and non-project-related matters.HR Recruiting Support Dedicated Account Manager In this staff augmentation model, which includes different functional areas, team members regularly  communicate with their direct functional manager on the client side for project-related questions.   The ClinChoice account manager is available to address administrative questions.  For the dedicated team specializing in a specific type of assignment, a very experienced ClinChoice  project lead is assigned. The lead is responsible for addressing all technical questions and for escalating  issues to our account manager. A sub-lead supports the project lead for specific tasks. The sub-lead  focuses on details within a smaller team or particular program study to ensure all project requirements  are met. This structure has backup support built within each level to ensure there is no interruption of  service and allows us to scale up and down as itâs a pyramid and has a responsible member at each level.Team Structure and Design4Clear communication with our clients is essential and begins with a kick-off meeting for each project.  The discussion includes set agenda items, and minutes are generated for both parties to refer to  during future KPI assessments. We communicate clearly and proactively regarding client expectations,  what is needed and when, the scope, and deliverables, along with the issue escalation process. Team  communications are tracked through an issue log where both parties document their responses to any  issues. This document helps identify major decision changes or deviations. On an ongoing basis, KPIs  are assessed with an emphasis on quality and timeline and reviewed during regular steering committee  meetings and joint governance committee meetings. Retention is key to any successful FSP engagement as it enhances opportunities for productivity and  efficiency. In a staff augmentation engagement, efficiency can only be achieved through a dedicated,  knowledgeable team and lead who has a history with the client and understands the clientâs protocols.  ClinChoice motivates our FSP employees through career advancement opportunities, competitive  benefits, and a culture of teamwork, integrating them into our company at every opportunity. Strong collaborative client relationships are crucial. ClinChoice establishes a flat engagement   structure to engage our clients at different levels of management with clearly defined expectations   and responsibilities. We monitor engagement closely, actively seek feedback and updates, recruit and  train new resources, and continuously optimize the process as needed. We constantly engage new  industry trends and initiatives to guide clients with innovative, proven solutions.Planning, Communication, and Evaluation Retention  Collaboration with Our Clientsclinchoice.com info@clinchoice.comAbout ClinChoice Inc ClinChoice is a global CRO dedicated to offering high-quality full clinical development  services to Biopharmaceutical, Vaccine, Medical Device, and Consumer Products  clients.

https://clinchoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Review-of-QA-on-regulations-for-Custom-made-Medical-Devices.pdf
REVIEW Questions And Answers  OnCustom -made Devices &  Considerations On Adaptable  Medical Devices And Patient - matched Medical DevicesContents INTRODUCTION PERSONALIZED MEDICAL DEVICES: DEFINITIONS AND CATEGORY OVERVIEW CONSIDERATIONS AND APPLICATION OF MDR T O CUSTOM MEDICAL DEVICES CONCLUSIONINTRODUCTION Rapid technological advancements, such as 3 -D printing, have made it possible for  manufacturers to produce personalized medical devices1much faster and on a commercial  scale. The European Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) recently issued a Q&A  document2to help address some of the key regulatory questions and clarify ambiguities  regarding custom -made devices (CMDs) defined in the new EUâs MDR3, and adaptable medical  devices and patient -matched medical devices described by the International Medical Device  Regulators Forum (IMDRF)4. PERSONALIZED MEDICAL DEVICES: DEFINITIONS AND CATEGORY OVERVIEW MDR Article 2(3) defines a CMD as any device specifically made per a written prescription of any  person authorized by national law by virtue of that personâs professional qualifications, which  gives, under that personâs responsibility, specific design characteristics, and is intended for the  sole use of a particular patient exclusively to meet their conditions and needs.5MDCG notes  that an authorized person does not have to be a healthcare professional, but any individual  qualified and authorized according to the Member Stateâs national law. It further clarifies that  the specific design characteristic in the written prescription contains particular information  regarding the design and measured data such as models, dental impressions, material selection  unique to the individual patientâs anatomic -physiological features, and pathological condition. According to MDR Article 2(3), any mass -produced devices adapted to meet the specific  requirements of any professional user and mass -produced devices utilizing industrial  manufacturing processes per the written prescriptions of any authorized person are not  considered CMDs. Since the MDR only provides a definition of CMDs and does not define any  other personalized medical devices that could be, for example, mass -produced, the IMDRF  identified and defined two additional categories of personalized devices: adaptable medical  devices and patient -matching medical devices, respectively. Unlike CMDs, these devices are  typically mass -produced or produced in batches and do not require a written prescription. The  Q&A document notes that the personalized medical devices that do not meet the definition of a  CMD must comply with all relevant sections of the MDR, including conformity assessment,  before placing on the market. 3Adaptable medical devices are intended to be adapted, adjusted, shaped, or assembled per  validated manufacturerâs instructions at the point of care (POC) to meet a patientâs anatomo - physiologic features before use, such as orthotic braces and hearing aids ( otoplastic and  amplifier)6. Per MDR Article 16(1), the individual, usually a healthcare professional, performing  these activities is not considered a manufacturer as long as these modifications do not change  the deviceâs intended purpose or affect its compliance with applicable requirements.  Patient -matched medical devices are intended to be matched to a patientâs anatomy within a  specified design envelope using techniques such as the scaling of the device based on anatomic  references or using the full anatomic features from patient imaging7. For example, 3D printed  implants from a template model, and DICOM files or contact lenses are made to order and  produced in batches.  As described in the Q&A document, in addition to MDR Annex XIII, CMD manufacturers should  ascertain and apply appropriate requirements of Annex I, implement a Quality Management  System (QMS) commensurate to the risk class of the device, and ensure compliance with all  aspects of Article 10(9). For implantable Class III CMDs, a QMS conformity assessment by a  notified body must be performed following either Annex IX Chapter I or Annex XI Part A.  Additionally, as per Annex XIII Section 2, the CMD manufacturers must establish procedures and  document post -market surveillance reports for Class I devices per Article 85 and Periodic Safety  Update Reports (PSURs) for Class IIa, IIb, and III devices per Article 86. However, CMDs are  exempt from UDI requirements, Summary of Safety and Clinical Performance (SSCP)  requirements, and registration of an appointed person responsible for regulatory compliance  (PRRC) in EUDAMED. Furthermore, the Q&A document clarifies when other devices, parts,  components, or materials specifically intended for the manufacture or use with CMDs may be CE  marked and what regulatory considerations for such âintermediate productsâ need to be  considered if placed on the market on their own.  MDCG encourages the application of CMD -related MDR requirements, such as risk  management, post -market surveillance, and clinical evaluation life cycle processes, to CMDs  grouped according to the same intended purpose, materials, and processes, same principal  design among other criteria rather than per each CMD. The International Medical Device  Regulators Forum (IMDRF) Personalized Medical Device âRegulatory Pathways8document  provides recommendations regarding regulatory pathways and considerations for applying  regulatory requirements for CMDs, adaptable medical devices, and patient -matched medical  devices. CONSIDERATIONS AND APPLICATION OF MDR T O CUSTOM MEDICAL DEVICES 4Even though the Q&A answers some of the key regulatory questions related to personalized  medical devices, the manufacturers should be prepared to address the inherent complexities of  device customizations and take into consideration all relevant regulatory requirements (e.g.,  intended purpose, risk class, manufacturing or design changes, manufacturing and use of  personalized medical devices with other CE and non -CE product, among other parameters) to  correctly categorize and classify their device, determine appropriate regulatory pathways, and  maintain regulatory compliance.  In summary, implementing the new MDR regulations and further clarification, including MCDG  documents for the manufacturers of personalized medical devices, may require additional  resources and personnel to ensure compliance with the new regulations and post -market  surveillance. Some of these may include: 1.Experienced regulatory intelligence consultants to interpret and apply the MDR, other  MDCG/IMDRF documents, and national laws 2.Liaisons to engage with Health Authorities or other regulatory agencies on behalf of clients  in the EU and other countries to assist clients in meeting regulatory, compliance, and  manufacturing/post -market laws 3.Robust medical device call center with experienced personnel capable of engaging with  relevant external stakeholders (including patients) to collect, document, and analyze  feedback regarding the devicesâ quality, performance, and safety in the field 4.Compliant infrastructure for incident reporting and experienced authors of required reports  such as Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5.Appointment of a person responsible for regulatory compliance as defined in the new MDRCONCLUSION 56REFERENCES 1,4,6,7 http://www.imdrf.org/docs/imdrf/final/technical/imdrf -tech -181018 -pmd -definitions -n49.pdf 2 https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/default/files/md_sector/docs/mdcg_2021 -3_en.pdf 3,5 https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/ALL/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2017.117.01.0001.01.ENG 8 http://www.imdrf.org/docs/imdrf/final/technical/imdrf -tech -200318 -pmd -rp-n58.pdfABOUT THE AUTHOR Alma brings expertise in regulatory affairs and quality assurance, with over  fifteen years of experience related to medical devices regulations.

https://clinchoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ClinChoice-MoCRA-White-Paper_22-Apr-2024.pdf
1MODERNIZATION OF   COSMETICS REGULATION ACTWhite Paper 2INTRODUCTION SAFETY SUBSTANTIATION &   REPORTING REQUIREMENTSThe United States stands as one of the largest cosmetics  markets globally, surpassing $87.7 billion in revenue in 2022  and expected to maintain a steady growth trajectory at a  5.6% CAGR over the next decade1. It is estimated that the  average American uses between 6-12 cosmetic products,  containing nearly 200 chemicals, daily2. Recent statistics  predict that the average American woman spends more  than $3,756 annually on beauty products and services3.  While cosmetics do not necessitate approval from  regulatory authorities in the USA, except for color additives,  they are subject to regulation by the FDA under the Food,  Drugs, & Cosmetics Act and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. In recent years, researchers have raised  concerns regarding the presence of certain substances at dangerous levels and labeling discrepancies  within major cosmetics brands. The enactment of the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act (MoCRA)  addresses these concerns by granting the FDA authority to access cosmetics product information, including  safety records, and to initiate product recalls if safety concerns arise. This marks a significant shift in  cosmetics oversight by the U.S. FDA, the first of its kind in over eight decades. 1 Cosmetics market size estimated to reach USD 661.12 Bn by 2032 by Yahoo Finance; December 8, 2023 2 Everything You Need To Know to Choose Safe Cosmetic Products by Andrea Sun, MS, National Center for Health Research  from https://www.center4research.org/cosmetics-safety-regulations-law-tips/ 3 Haynes, C. (2018). True Cost of Beauty: Survey Reveals Where Americans Spend Most. Available online at: https://www. groupon.com/merchant/blog/true-cost-beauty-americans-spend-most-survey (accessed January 26, 2021) 4 https://www.statista.com/forecasts/758635/revenue-of-the-cosmetics-and-personal-care-market-worldwide-by-country97.81 67.18 45.96 30.54 24.560 20 40 60 80 100 120 United States China Japan India BrazilRevenue data for top 5 countries in 20234 (Revenue in billion U.S. dollars) While the law does not enforce specific tests to demonstrate  the safety of individual products or ingredients for cosmetics,  manufacturers or marketers of cosmetic products are  mandated to maintain records substantiating safety through  scientifically validated robust methods. There have been  no significant modifications in safety substantiation and  manufacturers still can perform toxicological assessments on  ingredients using published databases such as the Cosmetic  Ingredient Review, PubMed or TOXNET. Additional testing  using scientifically validated methods is highly recommended  for cases where the published databases are not sufficient to  establish the safety of a product or ingredient. Many cosmetics products   are classified as drugs  or medical devices, and  implementing a flexible and  cost-effective safety system  can be a challenging task3 Furthermore, MoCRA includes additional provisions  that may seem straightforward to implement but pose  unique challenges. For instance, all manufacturers  will be required to register facilities involved in the  manufacturing and processing of cosmetics distributed  in the United States. The FDA will have the authority to  suspend registration due to suspected serious health  risks, which may impact other products if they are also  affected by the process. The issue cannot be isolated  and will prohibit the distribution or sale of any cosmetics  from the impacted facility in the US.MoCRA mandates new labeling requirements for all cosmetics products in the United States. By December  29, 2024, all cosmetics labels must contain the contact information of a Responsible Person capable of  receiving adverse event reports. The rule for professional cosmetics labels, mandating clear indication  of use by licensed professionals, has already been implemented. Certain fragrances can cause allergies  in consumers, prompting the FDA to issue a rulemaking for fragrance allergen identification by June 29,  2024. The final rulemaking is to be issued 180 days after the proposed rulemakingâs public comment period  providing additional time for companies to establish systems and policies to ensure compliance with this  labeling requirement.LABELING AND LISTINGMoCRA has introduced significant changes in how safety records, including non-serious adverse events  and adverse events, are managed by cosmetics companies. According to MoCRA, companies are required  to maintain records of non-serious adverse events for a specified period and promptly report such events  to the FDA via MedWatch. Furthermore, companies must designate a responsible person to report serious  adverse events associated with the use of cosmetic products to the FDA within 15 business days. While  these requirements align with common practices in the drug and device industry, cosmetics companies may  encounter challenges in implementing cost-effective solutions to comply with these regulations. Existing  solutions in the market are primarily designed for pharmaceutical and medical device companies and may turn  out to be cost-prohibitive, complicated and need additional quality requirements for cosmetic companies. Raw material and product  traceability will become  increasingly important  for companies, especially  one with complex supply  chain and third-party  vendor network4CONCLUSION In conclusion, MoCRA signifies a new era for the cosmetics industry, emphasizing safety and transparency.  Despite anticipated challenges in implementation, MoCRA promises long-term benefits of consumer  confidence and fostering a secure marketplace, thereby ensuring safety beyond mere appearance.Similarly, product listing is another provision under MoCRA wherein a responsible person will be required  to submit detailed information such as product brand name, active ingredients, formulation, preparation,  dose, and reference safety information, among others, for all products marketed in the United States.  While this may seem like a simple exercise for companies with limited manufacturing sites, for a global  cosmetics company with a complex supply chain network, these steps can easily evolve into a complex  cross-functional project.

1REGULATORY NEWSLETTER Oct 2023 - Dec 2023 GLOBAL COSMETICS   REGULATORY   INTELLIGENCE2 REGULATORY NEWSLETTER Oct 2023 - Dec 2023 Regulatory Intelligence  of Cosmetics - EMEA3REGULATORY NEWSLETTER Oct 2023 - Dec 2023 New QSAR assessment framework supports alternatives to animal testing. (Publication date  October 10, 2023) The framework helps regulators to assess quantitative-structure activity relationships (QSAR) studies, used  as an animal-free method to gain data on chemicals.  The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has published the framework for  assessing QSARs, developed by an expert group led by ECHA and the Italian National Institute of Health, ISS.  It guides regulators in evaluating computational results and enhances confidence in accepting alternative  methods for chemical hazard assessment. This helps build confidence in the use of QSARs and reducing  reliance on animal testing. Read More ECHA to prepare restriction proposal on chromium (VI) substances. (Publication date October  11, 2023) The European Commission has requested ECHA to prepare a REACH restriction proposal on certain chromium  (VI) substances currently on the Authorisation List of substances of very high concern. ECHA has received a mandate from the European Commission to prepare an Annex XV report for possible  restriction of at least the chromium (VI) substances that are currently in entries 16 and 17 of the REACH  Authorisation List (Annex XIV). ECHA will submit the proposal by 4 October 2024.The restriction proposal  aims to address the challenges posed by the current and possible future workload both for ECHA and the  Commission. This workload stems from the high number of applications for authorisation to use these  substances, already submitted or potentially coming from hundreds of companies. For ECHA, evaluating the  applications and concluding opinions on them would go beyond the available resources of the committees  for Risk Assessment (RAC) and Socio-Economic Analysis (SEAC) and would affect their work in regulating  other hazardous chemicals . Read More ECHA recommends more transparency in the trade of hazardous chemicals. (Publication  date October 25, 2023) The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), with the aim of improving the EUâs implementation  of the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Regulation, that governs the export and import of  hazardous chemicals and pesticides, is making recommendations for changes to the legal text.     ECHAâs third report on the operation of the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Regulation shows that the overall  workload of implementing the regulation, despite a slight decrease of export notifications, has continued to  increase due to the constant addition of new chemicals subject to PIC and the increase in substances subject  to explicit consent from non-EU importing countries prior to export. Read More4REGULATORY NEWSLETTER Oct 2023 - Dec 2023 Water-soluble zinc salts used in oral hygiene products - Submission II (Publication date  November 6, 2023) The SCCS has calculated aggregate exposure to water-soluble zinc salts via toothpaste at the concentrations  of 1% and from diet and concluded that the use of zinc in toothpaste is safe per se except for children under  the age of 1 year because the intake exceeds the upper limit level. For children between 6 months and 1 year  of age, the SCCS recommends a safe concentration of 0.72% for soluble zinc salts (as zinc) in toothpaste. The  inclusion of zinc in mouthwash at 0.1% Zn is considered safe across all age groups above 6 years.  Read More EU SCCS Releases the Preliminary Opinion on Benzophenone-4 (Publication date 15  December 2023) EU Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) issued a preliminary opinion on the use of Benzophenone-4  (CAS No. 4065-45-6) in cosmetics. The opinion is open for comments until February 16, 2024. Currently, Benzophenone-4 is regulated under Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009  (Cosmetics Regulation) as a UV- filter in sunscreen products, with a permitted concentration of up to 5%. In CosIng , it is also reported with the  functions of UV-stabiliser and UV-absorber, protecting cosmetic formulations against sunlight. In response to  concerns regarding its endocrine disrupting properties, the European Commission launched a call for data on  Benzophenone-4 in 2021. Based on the scientific evidence provided by stakeholders, SCCS has assessed its  use in cosmetics and prepared this opinion. Considering assessment results, SCCS is of the opinion that Benzophenone-4 is safe when used as a UV  filter up to a concentration of 5% in sunscreen, face and hand creams, lipstick, sunscreen propellant spray,  and pump spray, either used separately or in combination. Read More SCCS - Preliminary Opinion open for comments on the safety of aluminium in cosmetic  products - Submission IV (Deadline for comments: 16 February 2024) (Publication date 15  December 2023) In light of the new data provided, does the SCCS consider Aluminium compounds safe when used in cosmetic  products? In the event that the estimated exposure to Aluminium from cosmetic products is found to be of  concern, SCCS is asked to recommend safe concentration limits for each category and product type.  Read  More SCCS - Final Opinion on Methylparaben (Publication date 15 December 2023) In light of the data provided and taking under consideration the concerns related to potential endocrine  disrupting properties of Methylparaben, does the SCCS consider Methylparaben safe when used as a  preservative in cosmetic products up to a maximum concentration of 0.4% (as acid) when used on its own and  up to 0.8% (as acid) for mixtures of esters as indicated in entry 12 of Annex V to the Cosmetics Regulation?  On the basis of the safety assessment considering all available data and the concerns related to endocrine  activity, the SCCS is of the opinion that the use of Methylparaben as a preservative in cosmetic products at  concentrations of up to 0.4% (expressed as acid) is safe. Read More5SCCS - Final Opinion on Silver Zinc Zeolite (Publication date 22 December 2023) In light of the data provided and taking under consideration the classification as Toxic for reproduction Cat. 2,  does the SCCS consider Silver Zinc Zeolite safe when used as a preservative in cosmetic products according to  the specifications and concentration limits provided in the dossier submission?

This is the first time such  information is available electronically and is part of a one-year pilot initiative. The ePI includes details like the  summary of product characteristics, its labelling, and package leaflet. The published ePIs are for medicines assessed by EMA or national authorities in Denmark, the Netherlands,  Spain, and Sweden. Companies involved in the pilot create and submit the ePI as part of their regulatory ap - plication. The pilot, covering 25 medicines, will end in July 2024. The results will guide the integration of ePIs  into regular practice and their expansion across the EU. The ePIs can be viewed at the Product Lifecycle Management Portal  in English for centrally approved medi - cines and in the local language for nationally approved ones. Ongoing testing aims to provide access to ePIs  in all EU languages. More information is available here . News from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) EMA Publishes Revised CTIS Transparency Rules On 5 October 2023, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved the Revised CTIS Transparency  Rules , designed to speed up access to clinical trial information through the Clinical Trials Information System  (CTIS). These changes eliminate the deferral mechanism, which previously allowed sponsors to delay pub - lishing specific trial data and documents for up to seven years to protect personal data and commercially  confidential information (CCI). The removal of the deferral function means that structured data fields and  essential documents can be published earlier to meet the needs of patients and clinical researchers in the  European Union/ European Economic Area (EU/EEA). Furthermore, the number of published documents will  be reduced to simplify the process and lessen the workload for users involved in necessary redactions. The implementation of these revised transparency rules within CTIS, including its public portal, is expected  to be completed in the second quarter of 2024. Until the new CTIS public website is launched, during interim period, sponsors can already adhere to the prin - ciples of the revised rules for initial applications. They should provide versions labelled âfor publicationâ and  ânot for publicationâ only for documents covered by the revised transparency rules from 5 October 2023, and  upload a page with suggested wording in Annex I  to Q&A on the protection of CCI and Personal Data while  using CTIS, for documents that will no longer be subject to publication.Europe 5Unredacted versions of the documents to be assessed must be provided in the ânot for publicationâ slot to  allow proper evaluation by Member States. For substantial modifications or additional applications in Member States, sponsors should consider the pre - ferred approach for protecting personal data and CCI, aiming to decrease the burden depending on the trial  status, i.e., whether deferrals are already in place. For transition trial applications, sponsors should follow the principles of Q11 of the Guidance for the Tran - sition of clinical trials from the CTD to the CTR  and submit a redacted version âfor publicationâ only of the  protocol, subject information sheet, and ICF. For âhistoricalâ trials (submitted to CTIS before the new transparency rules are implemented), the structured  data will be published for all trial categories as per the revised rules, but documents will not be published.  The publication of documents in scope of the revised rules will only occur when included in applications sub - mitted after the rules are in place, regardless of previous deferrals or publication status.  For applications submitted in CTIS after the launch of the new CTIS Public Portal, the documents in scope of  publication of revised rules will be published and should be redacted accordingly. Additionally, the EMA updated the Q&A on the protection of CCI and Personal Data while using CTIS  by  introducing a new section 4 that addresses the revised transparency rules. This involved updating the text  throughout the document to align with the principles outlined in section 4. To enhance comprehension of  the revised rules, the EMA published a quick guide for users , summarizing the key principles and detailing  which structured data and documents will be published and when.   Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) - Sponsor Handbook Updated In October 2023, the EMA released version 3.03 of the CTIS Sponsor Handbook . Numerous sections have  been revised, incorporating pertinent links to guidance for transitional clinical trials, recently published guid - ance from the Clinical Trials Facilitation and Coordination Group (CTFG), cover letters for transitional trials,  Q&A on the protection of commercially confidential information (CCI) and personal data in CTIS, and various  other updates. The references to the CTIS Sponsor Handbook are also included in the âSponsor quick guide: Getting started  with CTIS .â This guide is designed to assist applicants in easily navigating the system and other tools linked to  the CTIS. Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (CTR) Questions & Answers (Q&A) Update In December 2023, the European Commission released version 6.6 of the Q&A Document for Regulation (EU)  536/2014 . In comparison to the previous version, the following Q&As have been revised or added: â¢ New Q&A 7.2 has been added (related to the definition of inpatient hospitalization in the context  of serious adverse events), 7.41 (providing information on the format of the Annual Safety Report  (ASR) for a non-commercial sponsor running a single clinical trial with an authorized Investigational  Medicinal Product (IMP)), and a new point 370 (clarifying that the preferred language for the An - nual Safety Report is English in all Member States, regardless of whether the submission is mono  national or multinational). â¢ Points 289, 294, 404 (now numbered 290, 295, 405) have been revised. â¢ Annex II updated: for Portugal, the Protocol Synopsis and patient-facing documents must now be  submitted in Portuguese and English. For Estonia, patient-facing documents are required in Esto - nian and English, with a note specifying submission of those documents in at least the official na - tional language(s) of the region(s) where the trial is conducted; English is optional. â¢ Annex III updated: for Hungary, the email address for Part I-related enquiries has been updated. For  Finland, the links to websites have been revised. For Sweden, an additional contact for Part II has  been added. 6Workplan to Guide Use of Artificial Intelligence in Medicines Regulation   EMA and the Heads of Medicines Agencies (HMAs) have jointly released an Artificial Intelligence (AI) work - plan for the period 2023-2028 . The plan, developed under the joint HMA-EMA Big Data Steering Group  (BDSG), outlines a collaborative strategy to optimize the benefits of AI for stakeholders while effectively  managing associated risks. Adopted by EMAâs Management Board in December 2023, the workplan focuses  on four key dimensions: Guidance, Policy, and Product Support: Ongoing support for products in development and the development  and evaluation of suitable guidance for AIâs use in the lifecycle of medicines. The public consultation of the AI  reflection paper (RP) concluded in December 2023, initiating the process. Work will commence in mid-2024  to prepare for the implementation of the AI Act. Tools & Technologies: Implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly chatbots, as predom - inant tools in intellectual work, such as personal assistants. A survey of the Networkâs capability to analyse  data, incorporating the use of AI. Collaboration and Change Management: Starting to use tools that find important information. Using smart  programs bit by bit and keeping an eye on how well they help. Asking the team about their ability to use  these tools. Publication of the AI tools policy for the European Medicines Regulatory Network (EMRN). Experimentation: Trying new things with AI every few months. Sharing important areas to study AI. Looking  closely at specific tools and techniques, like digital twins, to learn more. EMA Recommends Consulting the Released Notes for CTIS EMA continues to actively monitor user feedback, collaborating with stakeholders to implement ongoing sys - tem improvements and enhance the overall user experience. The latest updates are detailed in the published  release notes  and in the lists of known issues and proposed workarounds. One noteworthy update advises applicants to refrain from creating draft applications for Substantial Modifi - cations, Non-Substantial Modifications, or Additional Member State Concerned while the previous applica - tion is still under evaluation. Additionally, sponsors may encounter an error message when uploading new  versions of documents. Prior to reaching out to the CTIS Service desk, sponsors are encouraged to refresh the  webpage and verify if their changes are visible. Among the recent CTIS improvements, Member States now have the capability to provide comments on the  Request for Information (RFI) response even after the Reference Member State (RMS) has authorized the  application. Moreover, users can now download documents with special characters in the title. European Countries Public Holidays Saved in CTIS for 2024 The EMA has released a  list of official public holidays in European countries for 2024 , as documented in the  Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS). These dates, recorded in the CTIS, can impact the timelines for ap - plications. Public Holiday days or Winter clock stop days are not included in the calculation of timelines. Moreover, for multinational trials, where each Member State (MS) may have a different holiday calendar, the  process of selecting the Reporting MS will follow the calendar with the longest duration among the Member   States Concerned. The ACT EU Multi-Stakeholder Workshop on Methodology Guidance  On 23 November 2023, the EMA organized an event  where the Accelerating Clinical Trials in the EU (ACT EU)  initiative hosted a multi-stakeholder workshop on clinical trial methodology guidance. Stakeholders, regu - lators, and the European Medicines Regulatory Network (EMRN) collaborated to gain insights into various  stakeholder perspectives regarding the development of clinical trial methodology guidance. They discussed the current status of guidance on priority clinical trial methodology topics and exchanged  views on key methodology topics, emphasizing the needs of patients. The presentation slides  covering var - ious aspects of paediatric clinical trials from ethical, regulatory, and industry perspectives have been made  available on the EMA website. Additionally, all slides presented during the workshop, covering topics such  as randomized clinical trials, decentralized clinical trials, patient-centricity, and inclusion and representative -7Other Initiatives CTFG Best Practice Guide and Cover Letter Template Updated The Clinical Trials Facilitation and Coordination Group (CTCG) has issued updated versions of the Best Practice  Guide  and cover letter template  for sponsors transitioning multi-national clinical trials to the EU Clinical Trials  Regulation (EU CTR) and Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS). The revised guide now provides clarification on the concept of consolidated protocols, emphasizing the spon - sorâs responsibility to decide on the transition as a single clinical trial. It includes an annex with a graphical  example of a consolidated protocol version. Additionally, there is clarification on the background treatment,  specifying the status of non-Investigational Medicinal Products under the EU CTD considered as Investiga - tional Medicinal Products (IMP) or Auxiliary Medicinal Products (AxMP) under the EU CTR. Furthermore, the CTCG has approved an expedited and harmonized Member State evaluation procedure,  open until 16 October 2024, focusing on validating minimum application dossiers restricted to documents  already authorized under the EU CTD. Beyond this date and contingent on Member State workloads, this  expedited procedure may not be available. The CRFG will be working on new guidance and updated docu - ments, including a cover letter template, to assist stakeholders in simplifying the transition process from the  EU CTD to the EU CTR and simultaneously supporting Member States. ICH Adopts Guidelines on Viral Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology Products Derived from Cell  Lines of Human or Animal Origin  The ICH Q5A Guideline , which is an important set of rules, completed a significant step in its development on  1 November 2023. This guideline focuses on giving guidance about dealing with viruses when making medi - cines. The main objectives of the guidance are: 1. Capture key scientific and regulatory considerations to promote harmonization in the evaluation of viral  clearance, characterization, and testing. 2. Describe three main and complementary approaches to control potential viral contamination, which  include: â¢	Selecting and testing cell lines and other raw materials, including media components, to ensure  the absence of undesirable infectious viruses. â¢	Assessing the capacity of production processes to clear adventitious and endogenous viruses. â¢	Testing the product at appropriate steps of production to ensure the absence of contaminating  infectious viruses. This guideline is meant to be used along with other existing guidelines, especially ones called ICH Q2, ICH  Q5D, and ICH Q13.ness in clinical trials, are accessible on the EMA website. The outcomes of these discussions will be compiled into a workshop report on the event page, which will be  used to guide the future work of the EMRN in the development of methodology guidance.8News from Individual Countries  Austria BASG Fee Schedule for Clinical Trials Updated Effective from 1 January 2024, a new fee regulation by the Austrian Federal Office for Safety in Health Care  (BASG) has been implemented. This regulation applies to all applications received by the BASG from this date  onward. You can find the current fees outlined in the BASG fee schedule .   Clarification on the Decision by BAGS on CTAs Submitted via CTIS In December 2023, the BAGS provided clarification on the decision process  for Clinical Trial Applications  (CTAs) submitted through the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) where Austria is the Reference Mem - ber State (RMS) or the Member State Concerned (MSC). The decision on an application for approval, whether  itâs an initial application or a significant amendment, is made by the BAGS after completing the procedure. In  the CTIS, this corresponds to finishing the âAuthorizeâ task. As per EU CTR, completing this task is enough to consider the decision on the application. If itâs an authori - zation or an authorization with non-suspensive conditions, the clinical trial can start, or the requested mod - ification can be implemented. Furthermore, the following documents will be provided to the applicants: â¢	A confirmation letter of completing the âAuthorizeâ task, sent via CTIS upon completion. â¢	A national decision sent by post to the sponsor or national applicant outside of CTIS within the next  14 days. In the case of approval in CTIS, thereâs no need to wait for a positive decision, especially considering potential  administrative or postal delays. If thereâs a rejection in CTIS, the negative decision is the basis of any appeal  proceedings.   Document Templates for FORM and National Aspects for Part II The BAGS provided clarification on document templates for Part II  of dossier submitted under the EU CTR.  They emphasize that the templates published by the Commission in Eudralex Vol. 10 (âChapter Iâ) are accept - ed or recommended by BAGS and the Austrian ethics committees. If sponsors choose to use their own tem - plates, these must, at a minimum, contain the information found in the Commissionâs templates. Itâs crucial  that Curriculum Vitae (CV) must be both dated and up to date (not older than 1 year), and no signature is  required under CVs. Itâs recommended to use national templates for Part II, particularly for the Patient Information Sheet  and Site  Suitability Form . For Insurance Policy and Terms and Conditions, a national contact point for questions about 9Italy List of National Ethics Committees and Territorial Ethics Committees On 19 December 2023, the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) published an updated list  of National Ethics Com - mittees and Territorial Ethics Committees for the evaluation of applications for clinical trials. The list specifies  which Ethics Committees are willing to work exclusively through the National Observatory on Clinical Trials  (Osservatorio Nazionale sulla Sperimentazione Clinica â OsSC), both via the OsCC and Clinical Trials Informa - tion System (CTIS), or solely through CTIS. Contact emails for these committees are also provided.   Communication for Sponsors on the Migration of Clinical Trials to the CTIS system The AIFA issued an announcement  reminding applicants to prepare for the transition of Clinical Trials (CTs)  from the EU CTD to the EU CTR. Particularly, for submissions without proper planning and those not stag - gered over time, it is advisable to consider the deadline of 16 October 2024, for submitting the transition  application. This ensures that the procedural outcome is finalized by 30 January 2025. Additionally, AIFA published slides outlining recommended timelines for migrating clinical trials to the Clinical  Trials Information System (CTIS) .   Summary of the Meeting with Local and National Ethics Committees and Presentations On 21-22 November 2023, the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) and the National Coordination Centre of  Ethics Committees (CCNCE), in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, organized an event titled âMeeting  with Territorial and National Ethics Committees.â The event, conducted in a hybrid format (both in person  and online), saw the participation of over 300 representatives from local (CET) and national (CEN) ethics  committees, as well as regional representatives responsible for coordinating and governing the ethics com - mittees. The meeting provided a significant platform to discuss relevant issues, identify challenges, and ex - plore potential shared solutions. Participants shared their experiences and suggestions, contributing to the  enhancement of dialogue and collaboration among the various stakeholders. A summary of the event, including slides presented during the meeting  for downloading, has been published  by AIFA. GCP Inspectorate Communication on Computerised Systems and Electronic Data in Clinical Trials On 29 December 2023, the Italian Medicines Agency  (AIFA) GCP Inspectorate published a guidance doc - ument on the Guideline on computerized systems and electronic data in clinical trials , following the EMA  Guideline  on this topic. The document emphasizes the crucial role of investigators in maintaining accurate  and comprehensive records, including electronic data, during clinical trials. It highlights the need for regula - tions to responsibly adapt to technological advancements, giving priority to patient safety and data integrity. Inspections at Italian clinical centres reveal a diverse use of electronic systems, ranging from paper-based to  in-house software without validation. The recommended approach is to assess the impact of each electronic  system on participant rights, safety, and data reliability. A validation process, documented by a diverse team  and end-users, should be proportional to the systemâs significance. Leaders of healthcare institutions are en - couraged to ensure their computer systems comply with International Conference on Harmonisation of Tech - nical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use - Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) and  the EMA Guideline, safeguarding trial participants and maintaining data integrity for regulatory submissions. The AIFA emphasizes that the approach outlined in the guidance document aligns with the principles of  GCP-ICH E6 (R2) Â§ 4.9.0 and will be further elaborated in the upcoming version R3 of GCP , currently in the  finalization process.10Spain The United KingdomInstruction Document for Conducting Clinical Trials in Spain Updated The Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS) has updated Instruction document of the  Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices for conducting clinical trials in Spain. This document provides instructions for the conduct of clinical trials in Spain, specifically focusing on practi - cal aspects related to the application of Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (EU CTR) and Royal Decree 1090/2015.  The information is presented in a question and answer format and covers various elements, including the  Ethics Committees for Research involving medicinal products (CEIm) and the Spanish Clinical Trials Register.  This document is intended to complement the âcollaboration memoâ between the AEMPS and the CEIm, and  it is designed to be dynamic, with plans for updates to address any issues needing clarification or rectification  based on experience. The English version of the document is available here  and the Spanish here . New Streamlined Notification Scheme for Lowest-Risk Clinical Trials On 12 October 2023, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) introduced a new  streamlined notification scheme . According to the new scheme, initial applications for Phase 4 and the  lowest-risk Phase 3 trials will now be processed within 14 days, a reduction from the statutory 30 days. The  scheme excludes CTA applications for first in human (FIH), Phase 1, or Phase 2, as well as amendments cur - rently. CTA applications submitted under this scheme must meet specific inclusion criteria .  It is anticipated that around 20% of UK initial clinical trial applications will be eligible for this scheme. For details on the steps to follow when applying for a CTA under the New Notification Scheme, please refer  to the MHRA instructions. The UK for Costing and Contracting Process Reached Second Stage  In October 2023, NCVR (National Contract Value Review) entered Stage 2 , removing local negotiations with  NHS organizations, expected to further improve commercial set-up timelines across the UK. The NCVR process is a standardized, national approach in the UK for costing and contracting in commercial  contract research. It is led by National Health Service (NHS) England in collaboration with Department of  Health and Social Care (DHSC), National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Net - work, the Health Research Authority (HRA), and devolved administrations. The goal is to speed up activities  for commercial sponsors setting up multi-site studies, benefiting patients and the public. NCVR involves two tools: the UK interactive Costing Tool (iCT) for resource estimation and site-specific pric - ing, and model agreements for standard contractual terms. For multisite commercial clinical studies, the NCVR process includes creating the iCT, which is reviewed by an  NHS costing expert. Then the approved iCT is shared with NHS organizations, determining site-specific prices  using a UK-wide methodology for full cost recovery. The iCT output is integrated into the standard financial  appendix within model agreements, forming contractual terms. Since October 2023, NCVR became mandatory for late-phase (phase IIb and above)  commercial trials in  NHS organizations, significantly reducing set-up times. While not mandatory for certain studies (phase I-II  a, Advance Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) studies and studies running in Primary Care), many NHS or - ganizations voluntarily accept NCVR outcomes. In the past 12 months, over 600 studies underwent national  review, with more than 60 completing the set-up process. This analysis shows a notable reduction in set-up  times compared to pre-pandemic data, leading to more efficient study initiation.11UK Government Responses to the Review into Commercial Clinical Trials The government provided its reply to the Lord OâShaughnessy review of UK commercial clinical trials in May  2023. They accepted all the suggestions from the review and committed to five main actions. The ambitious  plan is set for a 10-year vision to come to life. Details on the next steps, a summary of recommendations  and responses, along with implementation timelines specific to commercial clinical trials, are available in the  MHRA report . Updates to the Commercial and Non-Commercial Model Agreements Recently, the Health Research Authority (HRA) provided two updates on contract agreements. In October  2023, guidance for commercial agreements was revised for all UK nations (England, Scotland, Wales, and  Northern Ireland). Key changes include: â¢	Clarification on archiving fees, which will be a one-time charge by participating National Health Service   (NHS) and Health and Social Care (HSC) organizations to sponsors, Contract Research Organizations  (CROs), or their agents at the studyâs close-down. This fee covers retention, destruction, and reasonable  access requests, and its calculation occurs at the close-down. â¢	Introduction of a new clause in the financial appendix, ensuring NHS organizations can defer fund use  into future financial years to enhance research capacity. In December 2023, additional updates were made. While it is recommended to use the December 2023 mod - el agreements, the October 2023 version will be accepted until June 2024. These updates apply to the following templates and guidance: â¢ Commercial Model Clinical Trial Agreements (mCTA and CRO-mCTA) â¢ Commercial Primary Care Model Clinical Trial Agreements (PC-mCTA) â¢ UK template Hub and Spoke Agreements Moreover, studies initially contracted without the General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR)-compliant  data processing clauses should have been re-contracted. For research activities solely involving data process - ing, commercial sponsors are expected to use the mNISA or CRO-mNISA  for contracting with participating  NHS organizations. Non-commercial sponsors involved in research activities solely related to data processing  should use the organisation information document  for contracting with participating NHS organizations.12North America United States of America  FDA Issues Guidance for Industry on Rare Diseases: Considerations for the Development of Drugs  and Biological Products On 22 December 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a guidance for industry titled, â Rare  Diseases: Considerations for the Development of Drugs and Biological Products â This guidance clarifies the  FDAâs thinking on important considerations in rare disease drug development to ultimately assist rare disease  drug and biologic product developers in conducting successful drug development programs.  The purpose of this guidance is to assist sponsors of drugs for the treatment of rare diseases in conducting  efficient and successful drug development programs. The statutory requirements for marketing approval for  drugs to treat rare and common diseases are the same and issues discussed in this guidance are encountered  in other drug development programs. These issues are frequently more difficult to address in the context of  a rare disease for which there is often limited medical and scientific knowledge, poorly understood natural  history data, sample size constraints, and lack of drug development experience. A rare disease or condition, in part, is a disease or condition that âaffects less than 200,000 persons in the  United States.â Most rare diseases, however, affect far fewer people.  The sponsor of an orphan drug (a drug intended for use in a rare disease or condition) may be eligible for  orphan drug designation and certain financial incentives intended to help make developing drugs for small  numbers of patients financially viable; however, the Orphan Drug Act does not create a statutory standard for  the approval of orphan drugs that is different from the standard for approval of drugs for common diseases  or conditions. FDA is committed to helping sponsors create successful drug development programs that address the partic - ular challenges posed by each disease and encourages sponsors to engage early with the Agency to discuss  their drug development program. 13Canada Health Canada Announces the Implementation of the ICH E19 Guideline On 21 December 2023, Health Canada announced the implementation of Notice â Implementation of ICH  E19: A selective approach to safety data collection in specific late-stage pre-approval or post-approval clinical  trials . Selective Safety Data Collection refers to the recording of certain data by investigators in case report forms.  It does not affect the monitoring and clinical care of individual trial participants or documentation of their  adverse events in medical records. It also does not affect regulatory reporting requirements. Therefore, all  safety reporting requirements outlined in the regulations must still be met. Examples of appropriate use of ICH E19 include:  â¢	Clinical trials to support a new indication of an authorized drug where the two populations are  similar (e.g., with respect to demographic characteristics, comorbidities, concomitant therapies), or  when the patient population in the new indication was well represented in the trials that supported  the approved indication. â¢	Clinical trials intended to expand the label information of an authorized drug with additional end - points in the same patient population. â¢	Safety trials designed to further investigate potential safety concerns focussing on specific param - eters. â¢	Clinical trials designed to provide additional evidence of efficacy. The protocol should clearly describe: â¢	Which data will not be collected or be collected at a reduced frequency. â¢	How the selective safety data collection will be implemented (i.e., for all participants, for a subset  of participants, after an initial period of the trial, etc.). â¢	The clinical trial application should provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the  safety profile of the drug has been sufficiently characterised to justify selective safety data collec - tion.14 MEDICAL DEVICES15 Europe  News from the European Commission   In December 2023, updates were applied to the Q&As on clinical investigations , marking the first revision  since their initial publication in April 2021.  The Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) introduced 19 new Q&As and revised 13, including Annex I  and II. Annex III, specifically addressing combination products, was updated to provide clarity on whether a  combination product study requires an MDR clinical investigation submission. The new general Q&As in the guidance documents address whether all clinical investigations fall under MDR  requirements. They also provide information for applicants regarding clinical studies involving combinations  of medical devices and medicinal products, outlining the regulatory pathway for conducting clinical studies  to collect data for both a medicinal product and a device, even if not a single integral product. Additionally, Q&As were added to the âTimelines section for Clinical Investigationsâ, highlighting Q 39 on  when sponsors should notify early termination of a clinical investigation and Q 41 explaining the duration for  retaining study documentation. New sections 48, 49, and 50, delves into the role and responsibility of the sponsorâs legal representative,  stating, âIn situations where the legal representative also functions as a CRO, it is recommended that the  agreement between the sponsor and the CRO clearly defines what responsibilities are assigned in terms of  the legal representative capacity and what tasks are assigned to the CRO capacity.â Annex I, focusing on clinical investigations under the MDR regulatory pathway, has been updated to include  additional descriptions to the legend. It clarifies that Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) studies without  additional burdensome and invasive procedures fall under Article 82 of the MDR, with relevant national  provisions applying. Medical Device Software (MDSW) and Hardware Combinations - New Guidance  The MDCG has released guidance on MDSW designed to function alongside hardware or hardware compo - nents . This guidance aims to clarify the regulatory considerations when the hardware or its components, in - corporating elements like cameras or sensors, are deemed medical devices or accessories to medical devices.  It also outlines scenarios where these hardware elements are not considered medical devices or accessories.  The guidance specifically discusses two cases: â¢	External hardware components (e.g., sensors embedded in a dermal patch) providing input data to  an MDSW app. â¢	Hardware components incorporated within a smartphone or wearable connected to an MDSW app  on the smartphone or wearable.16The Appointment of Five EU Reference Laboratories for High-Risk In Vitro Diagnostic Medical De - vices On 5 December 2023, the European Commission enacted an implementing act  appointing five EU reference  laboratories (EURLs) for in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDs). These EURLs were chosen from eight ap - plications submitted by EU Member States. The selected EURLs will play a role in assessing the conformity of  high-risk (class D) IVDs and will undertake certain advisory tasks. They specifically cover class D IVDs related  to Hepatitis and retroviruses, Herpesviruses, Bacterial agents, and Respiratory viruses causing life-threaten - ing diseases. The designated EURLs are slated to commence their tasks in conformity assessment starting from  1 Octo - ber 2024. In addition to their role in conformity assessment, EURLs have the capacity to offer scientific and  technical assistance to the European Commission, the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG), Member  States, and notified bodies in implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/746 (IVDR). EUDAMED Roadmap The European Commission has released the draft EUDAMED Roadmap , revealing that it will achieve full func - tionality until at least Q2 2027, followed by a transition period. The timeline highlights key milestones. All six  modules are set to undergo an independent audit by Q4 2026, with the Clinical Investigation & Performance  Studies module expected to be âaudit-readyâ by Q3 2026. The anticipated completion of the global audit  for all six modules is scheduled for Q2 2027. Following a six-month period post-publication, EUDAMED will  become mandatory, as outlined in the draft, in Q4 2027.  Additionally, a 24-month period for UDI/Device Registration and Notified Body & Certificates is stipulated,  becoming mandatory in Q2 2029. 17Guidance on Qualification and Classification of Annex XVI Products In December 2023, the MDCG released guidance on the qualification and classification of products without  an intended medical purpose listed in Annex XVI . This document provides explanations and examples for  applying specific classification rules to such products. Due to the absence of specific definitions in Annex  XVI, it is necessary to consult the provided product groups to determine coverage under the Medical Device  Regulation (MDR). The guidance emphasizes that to qualify a product as a device, we should ârely on information provided  in the Annex XVI list and in the scope sections of the common specifications (CS). Specific characteristics,  including product type, technology, functioning modalities, target body part, organ, or tissue, and intended  purpose, should align with the provisions. Tables within the guidance assist in interpreting terms for qualification. Additionally, a non-exhaustive list of  Annex XVI examples, along with their classification and interpretation, is presented for reference. Guidance on Demonstration of Equivalence for Annex XVI Products The Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) has published a guide for manufacturers and notified bod - ies, addressing the demonstration of equivalence based on data related to an already existing device. This  guide is intended for the purpose of CE-marking under the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and is appli - cable to products without an intended medical purpose listed in Annex XVI of the MDR, which are covered  by common specifications. For dual-purpose devices, those with both medical and non-medical intended  purposes, this guidance specifically applies to the non-medical intended purpose.  Questions and Answers on Articles 13 & 14 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) and Regulation  (EU) 2017/746 (IVDR)  In December 2023, the MDCG revised the Q&As guidance document on Articles 13 & 14 of the MDR and  IVDR , marking its first update in two years. These articles pertain to importers and distributors. The docu - ment addresses questions to offer additional insights into the practical implementation of Articles 13 and 14.  Noteworthy additions include new questions on âfulfilment service providers,â the role of importers and dis - tributors, system and procedure packs, and leasing companies. These updates aim to enhance understanding  and compliance with the Regulations in a more operational and practical context. MDCG Position Paper Notice to Manufacturers and Notified Bodies to Ensure Timely Compliance  with MDR and IVDR Requirements In November 2023, revisions were made to the notice addressed to manufacturers and notified bodies (NBs) ,  emphasizing the importance of timely compliance with MDR and IVDR requirements. The section titled âCall to manufacturers to transition to the Regulations and submit their applications for  certification without further delayâ has been updated. It stresses that, given the deadlines set by the Regula - tions, manufacturers are strongly encouraged to expedite their transition efforts and avoid further delays in  submissions. Manufacturers are  mandated to consistently provide data on the status of their devices. Additionally, a new section has been added, titled âCall to notified bodies to streamline the certification pro - cess.â In this section, the MDCG encourages notified bodies to simplify their procedures and exert necessary  efforts to enhance transparency, timelines, predictability, and consistency in their conformity assessment  activities. Notified bodies are urged to regularly share data on the status of device certifications.    Released an Overview of Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) and Notified Bodies (NBs) The European Commission has released an overview  of the CABs and NBs at various stages of the designation  process. This overview also includes the number of notified bodies designated under the In Vitro Diagnostic  Regulation (IVDR) and the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) as of December 2023.18Other Initiatives Team-NB Press Release Call to Manufacturers Action Team-NB, the European Association for Medical Devices of Notified Bodies, issued a âTEAM-NB Notified Bod - ies call to action to manufacturers to apply â in October 2023. Team-NB underlines that, due to increased IVDR requirements, delayed notified body designations, and the  impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the transition from IVDD to IVDR has been slower than expected. The  amending Regulation (EU) 2022/112, effective 25 January 2022, provides extended transitional time for  some medical devices (MDs) and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDMDs), with the initial deadline for  Class D devices set for 26 May 2025. The European Commission surveys  indicate that the initial conformity  assessment process for IVDMDs may range from 6-12 months for low to medium-risk devices (with quality  annex certificates) and 13-18 months for high-risk devices (with product annex certificates). TEAM-NB urges  manufacturers to promptly contact a notified body and submit their applications to ensure timely accep - tance under IVDR and completion of the conformity assessment process.19News from Individual Countries  Belgium United KingdomSite Suitability Template Adapted for Clinical Investigations or Performance Studies in Belgium The Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products (FAMHP) has released a new template for site suit - ability , which is mandatory for use in clinical investigations or performance studies starting from October  2023. This template has received approval from the EU Clinical Trials Coordination and Advisory Group to  align with EU CTR. Additionally, it has been endorsed by the Belgian National Contact Point and the Clinical  Trial College Board to comply with Regulation (EU) No. 746/2017 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDR)  and Regulation (EU) No. 745/2017 on medical devices (MDR). The Innovative Devices Access Pathway (IDAP) - Pilot Phase The IDAP program  aims to speed up the development of affordable medical devices and introduce them to  the UK market. As of December 2023, the MHRA announced that the IDAP Pilot is closed for applications.  Applicants can expect outcomes by the end of January 2024. To join this trial phase, a product had to meet  specific requirements for eligibility and innovation . If anyone needs help with their application or wants to  find out more, it is advised to write an email IDAPenquiries@mhra.gov.uk . New Contract Templates for Sponsored Commercial Research Involving Medical Devices The model Clinical Investigation Agreement (mCIA)  and Clinical Research Organisation model Clinical Investi - gation Agreement (CRO-mCIA)  were revised in October 2023 and December 2023. For all new Integrated Re - search Application System (IRAS) submissions (initial clinical investigations/ performance studies or addition  of NHS site), it is recommended to use the December 2023 version of the relevant agreement. However, the  October 2023 version will still be accepted until June 2024. These updated contract templates  are intended  for use without modification in company-sponsored commercial research involving medical devices in pa - tients in hospitals across the UK Health Services by all UK nations.20Switzerland New Requirements for Product Groups Without an Intended Medical Purpose and Alignment with  the Amendments to EU MDR and EU IVDR   Switzerland has modified its Medical Devices Ordinance  (MedDO) to comply with EU standards, particularly  Implementing Regulation 2023/1194. This adjustment takes into account amendments to EU Medical Device  Regulations (EU MDR) 2017/745, focusing on transitional periods for certificates, and to both EU-MDR and  EU-In Vitro Diagnostic Regulations (EU IVDR) 2017/746, addressing the removal of deadlines for putting into  service and placing on the market. The changes to the MedDO are effective from 1 November 2023. Swissmedic has updated its website  and released implementation guides accordingly. Simultaneously, a common specification has been outlined in the Federal Gazette, extending the require - ments of MedDO to product groups without an intended medical purpose.  The following guidance and form have been updated:  â¢	Swissmedic information sheets: BW600_00_015e_MB Clinical investigations with medical devices  (27Dec2023) BW600_00_016e_MB Performance studies with IVD (27Dec2023) â¢	Forms: BW610_10_021e_FO Authorisation clinical investigation MD (01Nov2023) BW610_10_023e_FO Application simplified review MD (01Oct2023) BW610_10_024e_FO Authorisation performance study IVD (01Nov2023) BW610_10_025e_FO Application simplified review IVD (01Oct2023) BW610_20_021e_FO Amendments, notifications, reports MD IVD (01Nov2023)21North America United States of America FDA Issues Updates to Final Guidance for eSTAR On 2 October 2023, the FDA issued minor updates to the final guidance: Electronic Submissions Template for  Medical Devices 510(k) Submissions . The updates are to support the use of the Electronic Submission Tem - plate and Resource (eSTAR) through the CDRH Portal. As of 1 October 2023, all 510(k) submissions, unless  exempted, must be submitted as electronic submissions using eSTAR.  eSTAR is intended to enhance the incoming quality of submissions for a wide range of medical devices by  helping to ensure submitters provide quality, comprehensive data for premarket review. With a standardized  format, submitters can ensure their submissions are complete, and the FDA can conduct premarket reviews  more efficiently to help promote timely access to safe, effective, and high-quality medical devices. In addition, eSTAR is now available for voluntary use for the following Premarket Approval Applications  (PMAs) submission types: Original PMAs; PMA Panel Track Supplements (PTS); PMA Real-Time (RT) Supple - ments; and PMA 180-Day Supplements. FDA, Health Canada and MHRA Jointly Issued the Predetermined Change Control Plans for Ma - chine Learning-Enabled Medical Devices: Guiding Principles On 24 October 2023, the FDA, Health Canada, and the United Kingdomâs Medicines and Healthcare products  Regulatory Agency (MHRA) jointly issued the Predetermined Change Control Plans for Machine Learning-En - abled Medical Devices: Guiding Principles . The 5 guiding principles outline key characteristics of robust Pre - determined Change Control Plans (PCCPs). PCCPs are one way to support the development of safe, effective,  and high-quality devices enabled with AI/ML technologies. In 2021, the FDA, Health Canada, and the MHRA jointly identified 10 guiding principles  that can inform the  development of Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP). GMLP supports the development of safe, effective,  and high-quality artificial intelligence/machine learning technologies that can learn from real-world use and,  in some cases, improve device performance. 22Canada Health Canada Implements Revised Notice for Implementing the Regulatory Enrolment Process  (REP) for Medical Devices Regulatory Activities On 15 November 2023, Health Canada issued Implementing the regulatory enrolment process (REP) for med - ical devices regulatory activities: Revised notice - Canada.ca . The Health Products and Food Branch (HPFB)  is implementing the regulatory enrolment process (REP) and use of the Common Electronic Submissions  Gateway (CESG) for medical device regulatory activities. The decision is based on the results of a pilot project,  which began in November 2019 and will end in June 2024. About 40 companies participated in the pilot. The  pilot was positive. All medical device companies are now invited to begin to use this process beginning in July  2024. At the moment, the REP is voluntary. The REP will be used to collect information from manufacturers on the company, dossiers, devices, regulatory  activities, and transactions. It consists of a set of web-based templates that generate REP Extensible Markup  Language (XML) files upon completion. Health Canada intends to make REP mandatory within 18 months  from the implementation date.23FDA Establishes New Advisory Committee on Digital Health Technologies On 11 October 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the creation of a new Digital Health  Advisory Committee  to help the agency explore the complex, scientific and technical issues related to digital  health technologies (DHTs), such as artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), augmented reality, virtu - al reality, digital therapeutics, wearables, remote patient monitoring and software. The Digital Health Advisory Committee will advise the FDA on issues related to DHTs, providing relevant  expertise and perspective to help improve the agencyâs understanding of the benefits, risks, and clinical out - comes associated with use of DHTs. The committee should be fully operational in 2024.  To support the development of safe and effective digital health technologies while also encouraging innova - tion, the FDA will solicit views from the committee, which will consist of individuals with technical and scien - tific expertise from diverse disciplines and backgrounds. This will help ensure digital health medical devices  are designed and targeted to meet the needs of diverse populations. Digital health is a rapidly evolving, cross-cutting space that spans a wide range of technologies. In addition  to the technologies mentioned above, it also includes issues such as decentralized trials, patient-generated  health data and cybersecurity. FDA Publishes FDA Voices on Clinical Trial Transparency and FDA Oversight  On 4 December 2023, the FDA published the FDA Voices: â The Importance of Clinical Trial Transparency and  FDA Oversight ,â by Robert M. Califf, M.D., Commissioner of Food and Drugs. The FDA takes its oversight of  clinical trials seriously and encourages voluntary compliance with the ClinicalTrials.gov requirements.  The FDA communicates transparency expectations and obligations under the law and use a risk-based ap - proach to prioritize compliance and enforcement actions for the violations that pose the greatest risk to pub - lic health. The FDA is committed to promoting clinical trial transparency and will continue to advance their  compliance activities related to the ClinicalTrials.gov database. Today, ClinicalTrials.gov provides a rich source of data regarding the state of clinical research, including infor - mation about research results. Almost half a million clinical trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov; how - ever, only a small portion, less than 15%, appear to be applicable clinical trials  (ACTs) subject to FDA oversight  of registration and results information submission requirements. OTHER âHOTâ TOPICS FROM UNITED STATES  FDA Publishes Final Rule on Increasing Options in Clinical Research to Facilitate Medical Product  Development On 20 December 2023, the FDA published â Catching Up with Califf: Increasing Options in Clinical Research  to Facilitate Medical Product Development ,â by Robert M. Califf, M.D., Commissioner of Food and Drugs. In  this âCatching Up with Califf,â the Commissioner discusses another critical component of clinical research:  âour work to harmonize clinical research regulations and to facilitate the development of medical products  to benefit public health.â The FDA issued the final rule  to help advance medical product development without compromising the  rights, safety and welfare of people participating in clinical research. The rule provides an exception from the  requirement to obtain informed consent when a clinical investigation poses no more than minimal risk to the  people participating in the research, and the research includes appropriate safeguards to protect the rights,  safety, and welfare of participants.  FDA anticipates this new rule will enable minimal risk research that would not be practicable to conduct  otherwise. This could include studies comparing the effectiveness of approved products to determine which  option works best for certain patients. Studies conducted with a waiver or alteration of informed consent  under this final rule could result in more treatment and diagnostic options without compromising the rights,  safety and welfare of people participating in those studies.  24The final rule permits an institutional review board (IRB) to waive or alter certain elements of informed con - sent, or to waive the requirement to obtain informed consent entirely, under limited conditions, for certain  FDA-regulated clinical investigations that pose no more than minimal risk to trial participants. The rule continues to protect the rights, safety and welfare of research participants and enables minimal risk  clinical investigations that may facilitate medical advances and promote public health. FDA Issues Update on In-Person Face-to-Face Formal Meetings On 18 December 2023, the FDA announced  beginning 22 January 2024, CDER and CBER will expand in-person  face-to-face (FTF) industry meetings (with a hybrid component), to include all Prescription Drug User Fee Act,  Biosimilar User Fee Act, and Over-The-Counter Monograph Drug User Fee Program (OMUFA) meeting types.  If an in-person meeting is being requested, the sponsor should specify this in their request.   A final determination on the format will be made by the review division and communicated to the sponsor  should the format be different than requested.  Existing meeting requests for the newly eligible meeting  types received before 22 January 2024, or meetings already scheduled regardless of the scheduled meeting  date, will not be converted to the in-person format, to permit fair implementation of the transition.25 About ClinChoice ClinChoice is a global full-service CRO specializing in clinical development and functional  solutions for pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, and consumer health  companies.

Reason for Change:  Benzophenone-4 was one among the priority list of potential endocrine disruptors  which were not already covered by bans or restrictions in the Cosmetics Regulation for their subsequent  safety assessment. Hence, a call for data took place.  Product list: All cosmetic products.  Source:  SCCS2. Benzophenone-4 44Status until Dec-2023 Change SZZ was a prohibited substance in  cosmetic products. SCCS published a preliminary opinion  open for comments on silver zinc  zeolite in April.On 22nd December 2023 â SCCS published a final opinion on silver zinc zeolite. Impact:  The SCCS considers that SZZ incorporating a maximum silver content of 2.5% is safe in spray  deodorant and powder foundation when used at the proposed concentration of 1%. Reason for Change:  In May 2019, SZZ was added in entry 1597 of Annex II of Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009  as a prohibited substance in cosmetic products. In August 2020, the Commission services received a dossier  submission by industry to support the safety assessment of SZZ as a preservative in cosmetic products,  in spray deodorant and powder foundation. A positive outcome of this assessment may support the de- listing of SZZ from Annex II and its inclusion under Annex V to the Cosmetics Regulation as an authorized  preservative. Product list:  All cosmetic products. Source:  SCCS3. Silver zinc zeolite45Status until Dec-2023 Change Preliminary opinion was published   in June.On 15th December 2023 â SCCS published a final opinion on  methylparaben. Impact: Based on the safety assessment considering all available data and the concerns related to  endocrine activity, the SCCS is of the opinion that the use of methylparaben as a preservative in cosmetic  products at concentrations of up to 0.4% (expressed as acid) is safe. Reason for Change:  Methyl paraben was one among the priority list of potential endocrine disruptors which  were not already covered by bans or restrictions in the Cosmetics Regulation for their subsequent safety  assessment. Hence, a call for data took place.  Product list:  All cosmetic products.  Source:  SCCS4. Methyl paraben 46Status until Dec-2023 Change Titanium dioxide is authorized both  as a colorant under entry 143 of  Annex IV and as UV-filter under  entries 27 and 27a (nano form) of  Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No.  1223/2009 (Cosmetics Regulation).  Considering its classification as  a Carcinogen Category 2 (i.e.  suspected human carcinogen)  by inhalation route only and its  inclusion in Annex VI to Regulation  (EC) No. 1272/2008 (CLP Regulation)  titanium dioxide was reassessed  by the SCCS. Subsequently, entry  321 in Annex III was introduced and  additional provisions in the existing  entries of 143 of Annexes IV and 27  and 27a of Annex VI were added that  further restricted the use of titanium  dioxide in cosmetic products.On 5th December 2023- SCCS published a preliminary scientific advice on titanium dioxide open  for comments â deadline: 6 February 2024. Impact: The SCCS considers that the available evidence is not sufficient to exclude the genotoxicity potential  of almost all the types of titanium dioxide grades (44 pigmentary and 40 nano grades) used in oral cosmetic  products. The only exception are two nano grades (RM09 and RM11) for which the provided genotoxicity  data indicate no genotoxicity concern. More information is, however, needed on the potential uptake and  cellular effects of the nano grades in the oral mucosa to consider them safe for use in oral-care products.  More experimental data are needed from studies carried out under valid protocols and appropriate testing  guidelines to exclude the genotoxicity potential of the selected representatives of the other grades of  titanium dioxide (both pigmentary and nano) used in oral cosmetic products. The conclusions drawn in previous SCCS opinions on dermally applied cosmetic products (SCCS/1516/13,  SCCS/1580/16) remain unchanged for the titanium dioxide grades and the coatings evaluated in those  opinions. The conclusions drawn in the previous opinions (and SCCS/1583/17, SCCS/1617/20) on the  safety of titanium dioxide used in specific cosmetic products that may lead to exposure by inhalation also  remain unchanged. Studies have indicated that oral mucosal cells are prone to the uptake of nanoparticles  (including titanium dioxide nanoparticles), as they may penetrate the mucous layer and may be internalized  by the epithelial cells. Considering that some oral products containing titanium dioxide nanoparticles, such  as toothpastes and mouthwashes, will be used every day and potentially more than once a day, further  investigations are needed to exclude the risk to the consumer from long-term repeated exposures of the  oral mucosa to titanium dioxide nanoparticles. Reason for Change:  In 2021, the EFSA panel has issued an opinion on titanium dioxide as a food additive,  where it has indicated a concern for genotoxicity. They have concluded that titanium dioxide should no  longer be considered as safe when used as a food additive. The commission has requested SCCS to re-assess  the safety of titanium dioxide with focus on genotoxicity and exposure via the inhalation and oral route  (lip care, lipstick, toothpaste, loose powder, and hair spray), since the currently available scientific evidence  supports an overall lack of dermal absorption of titanium dioxide particles.

On the same day, the Clinical  Trials Information System (CTIS), go-live version  was opened for users to submit clinical trials on  medicinal products for human use under a coordi - nation authorisation procedure. The deadline for the European Commission to  implement the CTR was to set up fully functional  portal which has workspace for sponsors, National  Competent Authorities (NCA) and the European  Commission. The portal which allows clinical trialsâ  sponsors to apply with a single application which  covers submissions to NCAs, Ethics Committees,  and public registration of the clinical trial in all EU/ EEA Member States. In July 2021, the European Commission announced  in the Official Journal of the European Commission  that the new portal named Clinical Trials Infor - mation System (CTIS) is fully functional and at the  same time, ready for use after six months of its  publication, on 31 January 2022. The announcement stated that Members States,  Sponsors and Contract Research Organizations  (CROs) started preparing intensively for the chang - es in the clinical trials environment. Fortunately, the CTR foresees a 3-year transition  period for sponsors to use CTIS. During the first year starting from the CTIS go-live  date until 31 January 2023, sponsors were able to  choose whether to apply for a new Clinical Trial  Application (CTA) under the regime of the CTD,  including using EudraCT, national portals or CESP  (Common European Submission Portal) or to apply  under the new CTR using CTIS.  During the second and third year until 30 January  2025, the EudraCT and CESP will not be available for new CTAs. From 31 January 2023, all new CTAs  must be submitted under the CTR using CTIS. CTAs  that were submitted under the CTD prior to 31  January 2023, will be able to continue to run and  be completed under CTD for an additional two  years maximum.   By 30 January 2025, trials submitted under the  CTD must either have ended in the EU/EEA or have  been transitioned to the CTR via CTIS.  If sponsors are conducting trials authorized under  the CTD and have at least one active site in the EU/ EEA on 30 January 2023, and they anticipate that  these trials will continue beyond 30 January 2025,  they will need to transition them to the CTR before  the transition period expires. However, clinical trials under the CTD that have  concluded in all EU/EEA Member States, even  if the global end of the trial has not yet been  reached, will not require transition. Additionally, data submitted through the CTIS are  collected and stored in the EU database. The CTIS  harmonises and simplifies the end-to-end appli - cation process over the life cycle of clinical trials,  harmonises assessment of safety reporting of  trials, accessing electronic reporting of Suspected  Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs)  by Sponsors and re-routing to Member States,  providing one single decision. In addition, the CTIS  offers searchable clinical trial information to the  patient, healthcare professional and the general  public. The results of clinical trials are shared in  the CTIS in laymanâs language. This white paper provides information on how to  be prepared for the new initial clinical trial autho - rization and substantial modification procedures  under CTR. Furthermore, it describes how to smoothly per - form the transition of ongoing studies into the  CTIS. Apart from that, it presents requirements  for streamlined reporting and public disclosure of  data.4SIGNIFICANT CHANGES UNDER REGULATION Definitions The Clinical Trials Regulation has retained some definitions and refined others. For example the definition  of âclinical studyâ: âAny investigation in relation to humans intended: (a) to discover or verify the clinical,  pharmacological or other pharmacodynamic effects of one or more medicinal products; (b) to identify any  adverse reactions to one or more medicinal products; or (c) to study the absorption, distribution, metabo - lism and excretion of one or more medicinal productsâ is similar to the definition in the CTD, but a âclinical  trialâ is defined more narrowly as a subset of a clinical study. The CTR defines a non-interventional clinical  trial as âa clinical study other than clinical trial.â The CTR introduces new elements like Low-intervention Trial and Auxiliary Medicinal Product. A Low- in - tervention Trial is defined as a new category of a trial which must fulfil the main conditions mentioned in  the Regulation, but requires less stringent rules, for example, regarding insurance, monitoring and Inves - tigational Medicinal Product (IMP) traceability. The precise interpretation of this definition is left to each  Member State where an application for authorisation of a clinical trial or of a substantial modification will  be submitted (Member State Concerned; MSC). Auxiliary Medicinal Product (AxMP) is defined as a medici - nal product used in a clinical trial, for example, for background treatment or rescue medication, but not as  an investigational medicinal product. The CTR uses the term âsubstantial modificationâ instead of âsubstantial amendmentâ used by CAs and ECs  in accordance with the CTD. The two definitions are comparable and cover any changes to any aspect of the  clinical trial which is made after notification of a decision, and which is likely to have a substantial impact on  the safety or rights of the subjects or on the reliability and robustness of the data generated in the clinical  trial. Initial Authorisation Procedure under CTR Submission One of the main aims of the CTR for the authorisation procedure is for the sponsor/applicant to submit one  application dossier, including a single set of documents in harmonised format via the CTIS regardless of how  many Member States are participating in the trial. Each Member State issues one decision per study. The CTIS has sponsor workspace (for sponsors, Marketing Authorisation Applicants (MAAs)) and  authori tiesâ workspace (for Member States, European Commission and European Medicines Agency  (EMA)). At the sponsor workspace, a sponsor or CRO must create the CTIS User Administrator role in the  system, which covers:   â¢ Assigning new role or clinical trial access;    â¢ Amending role or clinical trial access;    â¢ Revoking role or clinical trials access; â¢ Approving or rejecting user request for role. 5To get access to the CTIS, all users need to register by themselves in the EMA Identity and Access Man - agement System (IAM). Users receive their login credentials, a default role that allows them to access the  CTIS and perform a limited number of activities like to request a role or update personal profile. In order to  perform clinical trial activities for the particular study, the CTIS User Administrator needs to assign in the  system, the CT Admin who can be assigned to specific trial or all clinical trials for the organization. CTIS User  Administrator or CT Admin can assign user to study specific role in the CTIS.  In addition, sponsors need to create the Sponsor Admin role on their CTIS account. This role has full control  over monitoring the workflow of the clinical trial and can also assign new roles for specific clinical studies  for its organization. The assigned user with the role, for example, âsubmitterâ can submit the harmonised format of the appli - cation dossier for the clinical trial simultaneously to all Member States where a clinical trial is going to be  conducted. The application dossier should consist of: â¢ Part I Scientific Review â to be assessed jointly by all MSCs; and â¢ Part II Ethical Review â to be assessed by each MSCâs Ethics Committee separately The required content of the application dossier is presented in Table 1. Table 1.

The CT  Admin/User âSubmitterâ can submit Part I and Part II together, but there is also the possibility for them to  submit only Part I for review and approval; Part II may be submitted up to two years after Part I assessment  has been completed. Part II dossier may include recently published by the European Commission, harmonised templates, and  documents such as Investigator Curriculum Vitae (CV), declaration of interest, site and facilities suitability,  recruitment and informed consent procedure, and payment of compensation. Using harmonised templates by NCAs or sponsors across all of the EU are not mandatory, but strongly rec - ommended by the European Commission. NCAs inform the applicants whether the harmonized templates  are accepted by them, and whether the templates must be translated or if they should use the specific  templates published on the NCAsâ websites.  In the application dossier, the sponsor shall propose one of  the MSCs as the Reporting Member State (RMS), which will coordinate the validation and evaluation of  the assessment process of the application. There should be one RMS for each study/protocol. If no MSC  is willing to be the RMS or more than one MSC is willing to be the RMS, then the RMS should be selected  by agreement among the MSCs. In case of only one MSC participating in the clinical trials that MSC will  automatically be the RMS. The RMS shall notify the sponsor and, if applicable, other MSCs, that is the RMS  within six working days from the submission of the application dossier through the CTIS. Validation and Assessment The overall process, when Part I (Scientific Review) and Part II (Ethical Review) are submitted together, con - sists of two steps: validation and assessment. The dossier is validated by the RMS within ten days from submission taking into account comments ex - pressed by the other MSCs. If there is no feedback from MSCs the application dossier shall be considered  complete. If there is a request for information or any inquiries, the RMS sends a request for information  (RFI) to the sponsor and one clock stop is allowed. The sponsor has maximum ten days to respond. The  sponsorâs failure to reply will lead to the automatic withdrawal of the application in all MSCs. The RMS has  five days following receipt of the response to confirm validation to the applicant. If the RMS has not noti - fied the sponsor within five days, the application dossier shall be considered complete. Once the validation process is completed, Parts I and II are assessed in parallel within 45 calendar days and  up to 76 calendar days if there are any questions requiring an extension. Assessment of Part I and Part II submissions is carried out as follows: â¢ Part I Assessment: Scientific Part In case of a multinational trial all MSCs must collaborate in the evaluation and the 45 days reporting period  is then divided as follows: â¢ Initial assessment: within 26 days the RMS submits an initial Part I draft assessment report to  MSCs (in case of trials involving an advanced therapy or a biotechnology medicinal product, the  RMS extends the period by 50 days); â¢ Coordinated review: within 12 days MSCs review and provide comments to the RMS; â¢ Consolidation: within seven days the RMS consolidates the input from MSCs. The RMS, considering issues raised by MSCs, may extend the reporting period up to 31 calendar days. Only  the RMS can request for information (RFI) from the sponsor. The sponsor has maximum 12 calendar days to  respond. Lack of response is considered as withdrawal of the application in all MSCs. The sponsorâs responses are sent to all MSCs for joint coordinated review and the MSCs provide feedback  to the RMS within 12 calendar days. The RMS consolidates the input from MSCs within seven days and pre - pares the final assessment report. â¢ Part II Assessment: Ethical Part Part II covers aspects typically examined by Ethics Committees and is conducted separately by each MSC 7individually for its own territory. Each MSC shall complete its assessment of Part II within 45 calendar days  from the validation date. To obtain and review additional information from the sponsor the Ethics Committee (EC) or the National  Competent Authority on behalf of the EC, may issue RFI and at the same time extend the initial assessment  up to 31 calendar days. All MSCs and ECs have the same deadlines but, independently and separately, can  request for additional information. The sponsor gets maximum 12 calendar days to reply. In case of lack of  responses, the clinical trials submission will be withdrawn in all MSCs. Within the 31 daysâ extension and  after receiving sponsorâs responses, each MSC has 19 days for final assessment of ethical review. Decision The Regulation says that within five days of the final Part I assessment report or Part II assessment by each  MSC, whichever is later, a single decision must be communicated to the sponsor. The Ethics Committee  review may encompass aspects addressed in Part I (Scientific) and Part II (Ethical) of the assessment report.  The final decision is made after Part I and Part II assessments are completed. The clinical trial may be found  acceptable or acceptable subject to conditions, or it may be refused for all MSCs. The overall process of  initial authorisation under the CTR is illustrated in Figure1.

An overall process of Initial Authorisation Procedure under CTR Chapter II, Authorisation Procedure for a Clinical Trial:  https://ec.europa.eu/health//sites/health/files/files/eudralex/vol-1/reg_2014_536/reg_2014_536_en.pdf Assessment8If a MSC does not give its decision within the regulated timeframe, then the conclusion of the RMS Part I  assessment report will automatically be considered as MSC decision. Where the conclusion of the RMS re - garding Part I of the assessment report and clinical trial is not acceptable, that conclusion shall be deemed  to be the conclusion of all MSCs. A MSC can refuse to authorise a clinical trial if it disagrees with the conclusion of the RMS regarding Part I  or an Ethics Committee can issue a negative opinion in a MSC. The MSC shall provide for an appeal proce - dure in respect of such refusal. Individual Member States may decline to participate in a trial even when others have already accepted it.  The application can be withdrawn at any time by the sponsor, up to the reporting date, but only if with - drawn in all MSCs. Resubmission of the clinical trial is possible in the MSC in which the study has been refused, but it will be  considered as a separate new Clinical Trial Application with a new EU CT number. Substantial Modification Procedure According to the CTR, only substantial modification needs approval prior to implementation. A substantial  modification may affect a change to Part I, Part II or to both parts of the submitted application dossier. The  RMS for the authorisation of a substantial modification shall be the same RMS as for the initial authorisa - tion procedure. If the substantial modification concerns only Part I (e.g., Protocol, Investigatorâs Brochure,  or IMP Dossier), the RMS in cooperation with MSCs shall validate the application within six calendar days. If  there are any questions, the sponsor will get a maximum ten days to provide a response and the RMS five  days to confirm the validation. The assessment report shall be completed within 38 calendar days or 69  calendar days in case of request for additional information to the sponsor. Within five days, each MSC shall  communicate to the sponsor their decision on substantial modification. In cases where the substantial modification concerns only Part II (e.g., recruitment arrangement, addition - al site in a MSC) only the MSC, is involved in the assessment. The same timeframes apply for Part II as for  PartI, including 19 days for ethical review. When the changes affect both Parts I and II (e.g., change of main objective of the clinical trial or addition  of a trial arm, or placebo group), both will be run in parallel with the same timeframe. As is the case with  initial authorisation, the RMS will take the responsibility for coordinating the validation and evaluation of  the assessment process of the application. Addition of a Member State After a clinical trial has received the initial authorisation decision, the sponsor may apply to the same RMS  for adding another Member State. The procedures are the same as for initial submission. The CT Admin/ user âSubmitterâ must submit Part I and Part II through the CTIS for MSC evaluation, comments, or dis - agreement to the clinical trial. The submission shall be done through the CTIS and the MSC shall notify its  decision to sponsor within 52 calendar days or 83 calendar days depending on whether comments have  been raised and require an answer from the sponsor.9 Streamlined Reporting Under the CTR, the sponsor submits all Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) through  the dedicated new module of the EudraVigilance. The EudraVigilance clinical trial module for the electronic  reporting of SUSARs is upgraded in the CTIS. Upgraded module is a part of CTIS in accordance with Article  40 to 44 of the CTR and is maintained by the EMA. The EMA will forward the safety information electron - ically to all MSCs. The Annual Safety Report (ASR) (Development Safety Update Report (DSUR)) should be  submitted through the CTIS. SUSARs reporting should be shared with the Ethics Committees, but some  countries agreed that SUSARs will be not reported and reviewed by ECs. This task will be managed only by  NCAs. The European Commission published Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/20 setting up the rules and  procedures on the cooperation of the Member States in safety assessment of clinical trials. The Regulation  (EU) 2022/20 applied on 31 January 2022, on the same day as Date of Application (DoA) of the CTR and  CTIS go-live version. Implementing the regulation harmonizes rules concerning MS cooperation in assessing information report - ed to the relevant Ethics Committee. The EMA is also a controller of the CTIS and is responsible for avoiding  unnecessary duplication between the EU database and the EudraCT and EudraVigilance databases. The safety reporting via upgraded EudraVigilance module in the CTIS is effective on 31 January 2022. It  streamlines safety reporting and end-to-end electronic solution for safety reporting of clinical trials. The  CTR has kept the same timeframes for reporting SUSARs and ASRs as specified under the CTD: fatal and  life- threatening SUSARs - as soon as possible and in any event not later than seven days after the sponsor  became aware of the reaction; other SUSARs - within 15 days; and ASR - yearly. The CTD had no provisions to notify the CA/EC of the start of a clinical trial(first patient first visit; FPFV). The  only requirement was to inform the CA/EC about: the end of the trial (within 90 days);  a temporary halt and early termination (within 15 days). The CTR requires harmonised reporting of all clin - ical trial lifecycle events by obligating the sponsor or his delegated user (e.g., Contract Research Organisa - tion (CRO)) to notify each MSC within 15 days of all events listed in Table 2. The notification of events must  be managed through the CTIS.10Notification to be submitted Timeframe permitted Start of the trial in each MS Within 15 days Inclusion of first patient in each MS Within 15 days End of recruitment in each MS Within 15 days End of trial in EEA to all MSC Within 15 days Early termination to each MSC Within 15 days Global end of trial (including third world countries) to all MSCs Within 15 days Temporary halt and reason to each MSC (max. 2 years) Within 15 days Restart clinical trial after temporary halt to each MSC (SM  when halt was due to safety)Within 15 days Restart recruitment = Restart clinical trial Unexpected events Within 15 days Serious breach report Within 7 days Urgent safety measures Within 7 days Third country Inspectorate inspection No timelines Table 2. Clinical trial lifecycle: notification of events within 15 days (CHAPTER VI, START, END, TEMPORARY HALT, and EARLY TERMINATION OF A CLINICAL TRIAL): https://ec.europa.eu/health//sites/health/files/files/eudralex/vol-1/reg_2014_536/reg_2014_536_en.pdf Public Disclosure of Data Prior to 1 May 2004 when EudraCT database was established, clinical trial information was confidential and  available only to Member Statesâ Competent Authorities, the EMA, and the European Commission. After 21  July 2014, it became mandatory for sponsors to post clinical trials results in the EudraCT database. Accord - ing to the CTR, the EU database should contain all relevant clinical trial information submitted through  the CTIS. The information must be available publicly and includes: inclusion and exclusion criteria; main  objectives and endpoints; the start and end dates of patient recruitment; and the trial end date. However,   subject personal data cannot be entered into the CTIS. To protect an individualâs right to privacy and rights  to personal data protection, some information regarding clinical trials need to be anonymised. To maintain  confidentiality, certain documents must be submitted in two versions: one for publication (redacted) and  one for non-publication (not redacted). In October 2023, the EMA (European Medicines Agency) adapted revised transparency rules for CTIS,  including its public portal. The implementation of the new CTIS public website is planned for the second  quarter of 2024. The effective date of completion and application of the new rules will be communicated to  CTIS users before they become applicable. Prior to the technical implementation of the revised rules on the CTIS public website, certain information  will not be published. For Part I, the IMPD (Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier) IMPD Quality and  correspondence with authorities regarding this document will remain confidential. Similarly, for Part II,  financial and other arrangements with principal investigators and/or sites will not be disclosed. Therefore,  the submission of redacted versions of these documents is not required. Prior the launch of the new CTIS public website, Sponsors have the option to apply for deferral in the pub -11lication of clinical trials information in the CTIS. Deferral requests must be submitted only with the initial  Clinical Trial Application. For instance, for Phase II and III studies, sponsors may request to defer the publi - cation of the study protocol for up to 5 years after the end of the trials in the EU/EEA. Upon the launch of the new go-live CTIS public website, the deferral mechanism will be removed. This  decision aims to provide patients with access to key data and documents as early as possible, enhancing  awareness of potential treatment options. However, certain documents, such as protocols, patient-facing  documents, SmPC (Summary of Product Characteristics), subject information and informed consent forms,  and recruitment arrangement documents will never be published. Additionally, all other documents includ - ing IMPD Q, IB and Member State documents, will also remain confidential. The outcome of a clinical trial will also be published in the CTIS. The sponsor shall submit a summary of the  results of the clinical trial to the CTIS within one year from the end of a clinical trial in all MSCs (as set out  in Annex IV of the CTR). It shall be also accompanied by a summary written in a manner that is understand - able to laypersons and translated into the Member Stateâs national language (as set out in Annex V). In addition, when clinical trials are intended to be used for obtaining a marketing authorisation for the  medicinal product, the marketing authorisation applicant shall submit to the CTIS, the Clinical Study Re - port (CSR) within 30 days after â the day the marketing authorisation has been granted, the procedure for  granting the marketing authorisation has been completed, or the applicant for marketing authorisation has  withdrawn the application. â 3-YEAR TRANSMISSION PERIOD   By 30 January 2025, all clinical trials authorised under the CTD and only with active clinical trials without  ongoing document assessments in any EU/EEA countries are eligible for transition. In the context of transi - tion, an âactive siteâ is defined as one where the last subject visit or trial-specific intervention is scheduled  to occur on or after 30 January 2025.   The primary aim of transitioning clinical trials from the CTD to CTR is to streamline the administrative pro - cess and minimize assessments by Member States to meet the minimum requirements. There are essential principles for transitional trials:   â¢ No reassessment of previously assessed documents. â¢ No requirement for template updates. â¢ No retrospective creation of a site suitability form. Before transitioning a study, sponsors should consider three possible scenarios: Scenario 1: If key documents (e.g., Protocol, IB, or IMPD) have already been approved in all relevant Mem -12ber States under the CTD, the sponsor can transition to the CTR by submitting a Clinical Trial Application  (CTA) to CTIS without needing a substantial amendment under the CTD. The sponsor should declare the  approval of these documents in all relevant Member States under the CTD in a cover letter via CTIS. Scenario 2: If there are minor substantial or non-substantial differences in these documents across Mem - ber States (e.g., related to subject population age groups or administrative details), a consolidated version  may be transitioned as a single new version, without prior submission under the CTD. The sponsor should  declare that no substantial content differences exist beyond these minor discrepancies. Scenario 3: In cases where there are significant substantial differences among Member States regarding the  Protocol, IB, or IMPD, a substantial amendment (under the CTD) should be submitted to NCAs and Ethics  Committees in the Member States where the trial is ongoing. This is necessary to harmonize these aspects  of the documents across Member States before transitioning the trial to the CTR. Moreover, the estimated timeline for the transition process to the CTR, including validation, assessment,  and decision phases, may range from 22 to 60 calendar days. The validation process takes 10 calendar days,  including six working days for RMS selection in the case of multinational studies. Additional Part II docu - ments may be requested for some studies, with a 10-day period provided for the sponsor to respond. The assessment phase may take seven calendar days if there are no requests for further information from  MSCs. A decision from each Member State in the EU should be issued within five days. After receiving the decision, the sponsor should submit the first substantial modification via CTIS for Part I  and/or Part II to align with CTR requirements. Part I should be completed for the relevant dossier elements,  and non-redacted versions should be replaced with versions for publication at the time of the first sub - stantial modification application. For Part II, the sponsor should complete the relevant dossier elements,  excluding the retrospective creation of a site suitability statement. There is no requirement to upload new  template documents for trial procedures that have already been completed.13CONCLUSION Without a doubt, the Clinical Trials Regulation changes the rules for authorisation of all phases (I-IV) of clin - ical trials on medicinal products for human use. It harmonises and centralises the processes from the start  to the end of clinical trials. In addition, the information relating to clinical trials becomes publicly available. An independent CTIS audit, improving usability, quality, and stability of the CTIS successfully finished, and  on 31 July 2021, a major CTIS milestone had been reached. This allowed the European Commission to  publish the full functionality of the CTIS, and the same announced on 31 January 2022 as the date of CTR  application in the EU/EEA countries. To prepare everyone from the clinical trials environment, the EMA has  published the CTIS Sponsor Handbook, providing key guidance, technical information and references for  sponsors and collaborating organisations. Moreover, the EMA was hosting several webinars on how end  users can prepare for CTIS. The European Commission published harmonised templates and documents to support sponsors of clinical  trials when submitting Part II elements of the application under the CTR. A number of clinical trials guidance documents in Volume 10 of the EudraLex 10-volume collection of rules  governing medicinal products in the EU are being revised and updated by the European Commission to  bring them in line with the changes required by the CTR. The European Commission updates progressively  Questions and Answers Document - Regulation (EU) 536/2014 and discusses some inconclusive questions  with the Expert Group on Clinical Trials.  As of 31 January 2022, the Clinical Trials Regulation became applicable automatically for all EU Member  States. Preparing for the changes was a challenge not only for sponsors or CROs but also for Member  States. They had to set up communications between the National CA and the Ethics Committee, and to exe - cute ethical review of the trial for the entire territory. The CTR does not give instructions on how to manage  cooperation with the Ethics Committees. It says only that each MS is responsible for ensuring the Ethics  Committee meets CTR timelines and procedures for the ethical assessment Part II. Furthermore, the sponsors and CROs must take into consideration some aspects of transitional trials from  the CTD to CTR. They should start preparations for submitting the applications early enough before 30 Jan - uary 2025.  In addition to revising the transparency rules, the EMA will require sponsors to provide fewer documents  that necessitate redaction of confidential commercial information (CCI) and personal data. This change is  expected to expedite the preparation of the Clinical Trial Application (CTA) dossier. Removing the deferral  mechanism will grant patients earlier access to information, facilitating the prompt initiation of trials and  enrollment. To ensure easier access to pertinent clinical trial information, the revised CTIS transparency rules will in - troduce a more user-friendly CTIS public website. Changes are intended to simplify access to information  for clinical trial stakeholders, increase awareness of possible treatment options, rationalise the amount of  clinical trial data that needs to be published and eliminate deferrals, resulting in earlier access to important  documents. Many sponsors have relied on the deferral mechanism to delay publication of clinical trial documents with  minimal redactions of CCI. As a result, ClinChoice recommends that sponsors may need to revise their inter - nal procedures for managing CCI and fulfilling their transparency obligations under the CTR. Sponsors also  should ensure that all personnel involved in the submission of clinical trial applications are appropriately  trained on the requirements of the new CTIS transparency rules ahead of entry into application of these  rules in 2024.14The revised CTIS transparency rules are expected to apply in the second quarter of 2024, once their techni - cal implementation in the CTIS has been finalised. The EU CTR ushered the EU and EEA countries into a new era, in the way clinical trials are conducted for  sponsors, Member States, CROs and especially for patients whose rights, safety, dignity and well-being will  be better protected. Sponsors and their delegated users should become familiar with CTR requirements ex - plained in this white paper for initial authorization, substantial modification, reporting safety information,  notification of clinical trial events and plan properly for the transition of ongoing clinical trials from CTD to  CTR.15BIBLIOGRAPHY Clinical trials - Regulation EU No 536/2014 _European Commission - 16 April 2014   https://ec.europa.eu/health/human-use/clinical-trials/regulation_en EudraLex - Volume 10 - Clinical trials guidelines   https://ec.europa.eu/health/documents/eudralex/vol-10_en Functional specifications for the EU portal and EU database to be audited, EMA/42176/2014 Rev. 1 - 25 March 2015 https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/functional-specifications-european-union-eu-portal- and-eu-database-be-audited_en.pdf Clinical Trials Regulation (Eu) No 536/2014 Questions & Answers, Version 6.6 - September 2023   https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-09/regulation5362014_qa_en.pdf  Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) - Sponsor Handbook -  11 April 2023 https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/clinical-trial-information-system-ctis-sponsor- handbook_en.pdf Appendix, on disclosure rules, to the âFunctional specifications for the EU portal and EU database to be  audited - EMA/42176/2014â - 2 October 2015  https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/appendix-disclosure-rules-functional-specifications-eu- portal-eu-database-be-audited_en.pdf Guidance for the Transition of clinical trials from the Clinical Trials Directive to the Clinical Trials Regulation-  19 July 2023 https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-07/transition_ct_dir-reg_guidance_en.pdf Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 in practice, quick guide, Version 03 - 28 August 2023   https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-09/mp_ctr-536-2014_guide_en.pdf Revised transparency rules for the EU Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS)- 06 October 2023 https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/revised-transparency-rules-eu-clinical-trials-information-system-ctis16About the Author About the Author David R.

w w w . c l i n c h o i c e . c o m (Publication date Sep 25, 2023) European Commission (EC) has adopted measures restricting microplastics intentionally added to  products under the EU chemical legislation Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction  of Chemicals (REACH). This restriction will come into force later this week once it is published in  the Official Journal of the EU. The ban uses a broad definition of microplastics âit covers all  synthetic polymer particles below five millimeters that are organic, insoluble and resist  degradation. Cosmetics where microplastics are used for multiple purposes, such as exfoliation  (microbeads) or obtaining a specific texture, fragrance, or color, will no longer be allowed.  Read More   (Publication date Aug 02, 2023) The EU has introduced a crucial amendment to its Cosmetic Regulation that focuses on the labeling  of fragrance allergens in cosmetic products. Commission Regulation (EU)2023/1545, which was  introduced on July 26, 2023, amends Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 of the European Parliament.  The committee identified 56 new fragrance allergens, which have been known to cause allergies in  humans but currently lack individual labelling requirements. Considering the SCCS opinion and the  potential risk to human health associated with these additional fragrance allergens, the EU  deemed it necessary to inform consumers about their presence in cosmetic products.  Consequently, Commission Regulation (EU) 2023/1545 introduces an obligation to individually label  these fragrance allergens when their concentration exceeds 0.001% in leave -on products and  0.01% in rinse -off products. Read More   (Publication date Aug 08, 2023) On 8th August 2023, the European Commission published Delegated Regulation (EU)2023/1608 of  30 May 2023, which amend Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 of 30 May 2023. This relates to  persistent organic pollutants (POP), which updates specially concerning perfluorohexane sulfonic  acid ( PFHxS ), its salts and PFHxS -related compounds, which have been adopted in the new version  published.The amendment adds the substance Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid ( PFHxS ), its salts and  PFHxS related compounds to Part A of Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 (POP), which lists  substances prohibited to be used for manufacturing, placing on the European market, and use. Read More  (Publication date September 15, 2023) There is an ongoing call for data on the safety of Cannabidiol (CBD) in cosmetic products. On June  1, 2023, the European Commission invited all interested parties to submit any scientific  information about the use of CBD in cosmetics. The consultation will remain open until September  30, 2024. The data collected will be the basis for mandating the Scientific Committee on Consumer  Safety (SCCS) to assess the safety of CBD in cosmetics as well as the safe trace level of  Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This process aims at harmonising the rules at the EU level on the use of CBD in cosmetic products.  Indeed, in recent years, several EU Member States have raised concerns about the potential risk of  CBD for consumersâ health and, at the moment, there are some national discrepancies. Read More (Publication date July 26, 2023) EU released the Commission Decision (EU) 2023/1540 to amend the Ecolabel criteria for cosmetic  products.

Read More(Publication date July 04, 2023) The European Union Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) published the preliminary  opinion on water -soluble zinc salts (SCCS/1657/23). The deadline for comments is set for  September 8, 2023. The SCCS has calculated aggregate exposure to water -soluble zinc salts via toothpaste at the  concentrations of 1% and from diet and concluded that the use of zinc in toothpaste is safe per se  except for children under the age of one because the intake exceeds the upper limit level. For  children up to the age of one, the SCCS recommends a safe concentration of 0.72% for soluble zinc  salts (as zinc) in toothpaste. The inclusion of zinc in mouthwash at 0.1% is considered safe across  all age groups. Read More  (Publication date 22 September 2023) In view of the conclusions of SCCS/1633/21 and the aggregate exposure, the SCCS considers the  use of Methyl Salicylate as safe in cosmetic products intended for children of age 0.5 -3 years when  used up to a maximum concentration of 0.02% in shower gel, hand soap, shampoo, body lotion,  face cream, hand cream, lip products and hair conditioner. For toothpaste up to a maximum  concentration of 2.52% methyl salicylate is considered safe. As no specific data were provided by the applicant for children below 6 months, the SCCS has not  considered this age category in this safety assessment.

SAFETY ASSESSMENT OF  E-CIGARETTES IN THE EU  Authors:  Pradeep Kumar and Shrutismita Electronic cigarettes (EC) are deï¬ned as products that can be used for the  consumption of a nicotine-containing aerosol via a mouthpiece, or any  component of that product, including a cartridge, a tank, and the device without  a cartridge or tank (1). EC and heated tobacco products (HTP) are becoming  popular alternatives to cigarettes in several countries. For example, since their  introduction, HTPs have partially replaced cigarettes in Japan, while the  prevalence of EC has risen in the United States and other countries. EC aerosols  are generated from the heating of liquids, and HTP aerosols are generated from  the heating of tobacco at temperatures far below the combustion temperatures  observed for cigarettes. Consequently, lower concentrations of harmful and  potentially harmful constituents (HPHC) in their aerosols are measured when  compared to mainstream smoke from reference  or commercial cigarettes (2). An  EC is a part of an emerging class of electronic nicotine-delivery systems (ENDS)  that aerosolize nicotine and produce a vapor that emulates that of tobacco  cigarettes but purportedly has fewer traditional harmful substances than  second-hand smoke  (3 ). For the ï¬rst time, EU Directive Article 20 of the Tobacco  Products introduces a comprehensive regulatory framework for ECs with a focus  on safety, quality, consumer protection, and collection of information. EC are  recent products in the EU market, and evidence concerning their potential risks  and beneï¬ts is emerging (1). The EU Commission and Member States are monitoring scientiï¬c evidence, user  proï¬les, and market developments regarding all EC, given their increased usage.  Open questions for the use of EC are:  â¢Adverse health eï¬ects (short- and long-term eï¬ects) caused due to EC â¢Role of EC as a gateway to smoking/the initiation of smoking (mainly  â¢focusing on young people) â¢Role of EC in harm reduction/cessation of traditional tobacco smoking (1)1. Introduction 2. Background and mechanism EC regulated as medicines may be made available in strengths and volumes  greater than those permitted under the Tobacco and Related Products  Regulations (TRPR) (i.e., containing more than 20 mg/ml nicotine, more than 2 ml  for single use cartridge/disposable products or more than 10 ml for reï¬ll  containers) and follows the EU MDR safety regulation 2002. Lesser volumes or  strengths fall under consumer products (4). For assessing the safety, the toxicological consequences of heating and  vaporizing the formulation of nicotine and excipients during the normal use of  the product need to be considered. For example, particular concern has been  raised in studies about the presence of acrolein and other carbonyls, such as  formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, that can be produced as a consequence of the  thermal decomposition of glycerol and propylene glycol. Analytical chemistry  data should be used to conï¬rm the compounds present in the vapor produced by  an e-cigarette device under its normal operating conditions . Information on the  potential toxicity of any degradation products at relevant exposure levels and all  routes of exposure should be provided (4).â¢First-generation devices: cig-like devices have the most physical resemblance  to traditional cigarettes. They aï¬ord the least amount of user control over  heating. Nicotine delivery is not as eï¬cient as compared to newer devices.  â¢Second-generation models: larger, enable voltage adjustment by users, and  higher-capacity lithium-ion rechargeable batteries.  â¢Third generation: Removable and rechargeable large batteries (external) with  user control (both voltage and wattage) tanks containing more e-liquid that is  heated at higher temperatures. These models o/f_ten contain sub-ohm  resistance heating coils that aid users in generating relatively large aerosol  volumes.  â¢Fourth generation: Enable control over the temperature of the heating coil.  â¢Fi/f_th generation: Use changeable, nicotine salt-based liquid cartridges and  temperature regulation to produce an aerosol as an alternative to traditional  cigarettes (1).Currently, there are ï¬ve generations of EC in the EU (1)  3. Safety requirements of EC as per EU Glycerol: The most appropriate study for PoD derivation is the rat experiment.  The main eï¬ects consisted of local irritation when rats were exposed to 662  mg/m3, 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 13 weeks reported squamous metaplasia of  the epithelium lining of the epiglottis. No toxic eï¬ects were reported at an  exposure concentration of 165 mg/m3. No systemic eï¬ects were reported in this  study or in a study with rats exposed to concentrations of up to 3910 mg/m3, 6  hours/day, 5 days/week for 14 days. Hence, the No Observed Adverse Eï¬ect  Level of 165 mg/m3 for a 6-hour exposure was chosen as PoD for glycerol (5).Example for Point of Departure (PoD) selection: Due to the large number of devices and liquids present in the market and also a  large variation in individual exposures due to the variability in concentrations in  the inhaled aerosol, duration of exposure, frequency of exposure events  (electronic cigarette use sessions), and the frequency of inhalation during  sessions of electronic cigarette use are great challenges for the exposure  assessment for users of EC and those exposed to exhaled air from these users. Aerosol characteristics play a major role in exposure assessment, composed of  droplets of e-liquids, which contain mainly propylene glycol, glycerol, nicotine,  water, ï¬avorings (if added), and small amounts of by-products of thermal  decomposition of some of these constituents. Inhaled aerosol is highly  concentrated and contains mainly submicrometric-size particles. Electronic  cigarette aerosol is composed of droplets of e-liquids surrounded by air and a  mixture of aerosols. Based on laboratory simulation, a 10-puï¬ session would  result in inhaling 2.5â72.5 mg e-liquid, with 37â69% of aerosol being < 4 Âµm in  size (highly respirable). For e-liquid containing 20 mg/mL nicotine, this would be  an intake of 0.08â1.45 mg nicotine/session. Data on total puï¬ volume and  nicotine intake can contribute to the development of a standard protocol for  laboratory testing of electronic cigarette products (1).4. Exposure Assessment The compounds identiï¬ed in the aerosols inhaled by users of EC originate from  the liquids used or directly from the electronic cigarette device or indirectly from  chemical reactions . It is noted that, in view of the rapidly changing nature of  electronic devices used, some exposure data may not apply anymore or may only  be valid in speciï¬c EU countries . The relevant compounds for the risk assessment in EC aerosols are mainly the  solvent carriers (glycols and glycerol), nicotine, ï¬avorings, nitrosamines (TSNAs),  by-products of thermal decomposition of some of these constituents, notably  carbonyls, and metals originating from the device (1). 4.1 Primary exposure EC users partially exhale harmful components because electronic cigarettes are  only active when users take a puï¬ and do not produce aerosol when no puï¬ is  being taken. Therefore, they do not emit harmful compounds when no puï¬ is  taken, unlike tobacco cigarettes. Nevertheless, non-users may be exposed to  exhaled air following a puï¬ (1).4.2 Second-hand exposure Most of the ingredients and additives used in traditional cigarettes and other  tobacco products, along with nicotine and its derivates, were  among the most  used ingredients in e-liquids. Some of them are included in the 15 priority  chemical substances list by the scientiï¬c committee on emerging and newly  identiï¬ed health risks in its Opinion Tobacco Additives 1, used by the EU  Commission. These include nicotine, solvent carriers (propylene glycol, ethylene  glycol, and glycerol), tobacco-speciï¬c nitrosamines (TSNAs), volatile organic  compounds (VOCs), phenolic compounds, ï¬avorings, and tobacco alkaloids can be  found in the aerosols of EC. In addition, the aerosols also contain pyrolysis  products of the liquids (i.e., aldehydes, free radicals, and reactive oxygen species,  furans) and metals originating from the heated device.5. Hazard Identiï¬cation These above-mentioned ingredients can be toxic, aï¬ecting diï¬erent target  organs and with diï¬erent mechanisms involved. Additionally, reactions between  the ingredients can also occur, leading to other chemical formations, such as  aldehydes, among others. (1). No harmonized classiï¬cation was present for most  of the ingredients listed in e-liquids and aerosol components to identify the  hazard, and the toxicological proï¬le has not been thoroughly investigated.  Hence, based on the comparison between measured exposure levels in aerosols  and health-based guidance values, the overall weight of evidence for the risk of  respiratory tract carcinogenicity due to long-term cumulative exposure to  nitrosamines, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde, is weak to moderate (1). Nicotine is a parasympathomimetic alkaloid that stimulates the heart rate and  blood pressure at low doses and also acts on the gastrointestinal tract and the  central nervous system. The dose route and duration of administration determine  whether there will be a stimulating or an inhibiting eï¬ect on blood circulation. At  toxic doses, central stimulation is followed by inhibition, e.g., central inhibition of  respiration. Concerning the intoxication of humans, estimates range from 60 mg  from self-testing up to more recent estimates of 0.5â1 g of ingested nicotine,  corresponding to an oral lethal dose 50  of 6.5â13 mg/kg. According to the  harmonized classiï¬cation and labeling approved by the EU, nicotine is fatal if  swallowed, in contact with skin, if inhaled, and is toxic to aquatic life with  long-lasting eï¬ects (1). Toxicological data on some endpoints (i.e., CMR (6),  cardiovascular, respiratory system, among others) and eï¬ects on the health of  consumers when inhaled, along with data on any addictive eï¬ect, information on  the nicotine doses and uptake when consumed under normal or reasonably  foreseeable conditions are required for the nicotine formulations along with  excipients (7). Results of exposure assessments will be compared against the safety comparator  for each ingredient/impurity/degradant present in the EC aerosol. Risk  assessment was performed based on measured aerosol concentrations (below  table ) and the identiï¬ed hazards and human health impacts. In addition, a  comparison is made to the list of compounds recommended to be measured in  the ECs aerosol, according to the tobacco and electronic cigarette industry for  regulatory submission under the TPD and to the list of the European Association  for the Co-ordination of Consumer Representation in Standardisation (1).6. Risk assessment Nicotine exposure may induce eï¬ects on the respiratory tract since the alveolar  concentrations calculated are higher than or comparable to eï¬ect concentrations  in human volunteer studies, showing coughing and constriction of the airways.  Systemic eï¬ects on the cardiovascular system are considered possible since the  absorbed doses are higher than eï¬ect levels in human volunteer studies with  nicotine, showing changes in heart-beat and systolic blood pressure. There may  be a risk for adverse eï¬ects on the fetus for heavy users since the absorbed  doses calculated were slightly lower than eï¬ect concentrations in a study with  monkeys (1).

Users AssessmentFig 1.Stepwise, pragmatic approach for the risk assessment of individual  components in EC aerosols (5) For local eï¬ects on the respiratory tract, the margin of exposure (MoE) was based  on the approximate maximum median alveolar concentration calculated from the  puï¬ dose, the volume/puï¬ (70 ml), a low absorption rate (30%) and the dilution  rate in the lungs. With respect to the latter: the aerosol concentration in the  respiratory tract will be reduced since, together with the  Light user: 15 inhalations per  day, 1 puï¬ per 4 minutes, with a  total daily use duration of sixty  minutesAverage user: 60 inhalations per  day, 1 puï¬ per 2 minutes with a  total daily use duration of 120  minutesHeavy user: 500 inhalations per  day, 2 puï¬s per minute with a  total daily use duration of 240  minutesExposure assessment Margin of exposure (MoE) evaluationHazard assessment (PoD determination) Step 1a.

Conclusionpuï¬, air will be inhaled. For systemic eï¬ects, the MoE was based on the  calculated total absorbed daily dose. On the hazard side, a suitable animal  experiment can be chosen to derive the PoD (1). Risk assessment was proposed based on the MoE approach. The choice of an  appropriate dose metric, such as inhaled concentration and absorbed dose,  depends on the type of eï¬ect. Temporal characteristics also should be considered  in the ï¬nal step of the MoE approach (5). The minimal value required for the MoE  to come to a conclusion of no or low concern depends on the hazard information  available and on the exposure characteristics, and thus, will be diï¬erent for  diï¬erent scenarios (1). Natural impurities in nicotine are nicotine-N-oxides, cotinine, nornicotine,  anatabine, myosmine, anabasine, and Î²-nicotyrine which are not considered as  carcinogens along with nicotine. Other impurities like N-Nitrosonornicotine,  nitrosamine ketone and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol are  suspected to cause cancer in humans; this is the area where there is no speciï¬c  process for conducting safety assessments mentioned; based on the levels in  aerosol concentration their safety will be addressed (1) An average reduction in concentrations of more than 90% among given lists of  HPHCs has been observed in the aerosol of commercial HTPs or EC against their  concentrations in commercial cigarette smoke (2). Research performed in a European context and focused on EU policy needs is still  limited and needs to set out requirements for nicotine-containing liquids,  including prohibiting certain additives. 8.

SAFETY ASSESSMENT OF  E-CIGARETTES IN US Authors:  Pradeep Kumar and Shrutismita In the US, electronic cigarettes (EC) fall in electronic nicotine delivery  systems(ENDS) and usually contain nicotine derived from tobacco, ï¬avorings,  propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, and other ingredients. These EC are  electrically-driven devices consisting of the battery part and liquid, in an  atomizer, which is aerosolized by applying energy and generating heat to a  resistance encircling a wick. The substances mentioned above aï¬ect nicotine  delivery, appeal, and ease of product use, inï¬uencing individual preferences that  may play a role in use patterns. The popularity of EC is due to their ability to deal  both with the physical (i.e., nicotine) and the behavioral component of smoking  addiction. Sensory stimulation and simulation of smoking behavior and cigarette  manipulation are important elements of a productâs eï¬ectiveness in reducing or  completely substituting conventional smoking/cigarettes, which are generally  absent in nicotine replacement therapies and oral medications for nicotine  dependence. This justiï¬es why these products can be eï¬ective in lowering the  consumption of tobacco smoking and are eï¬cient as long-term replacements for  a conventional cigarette or cigar (1) Currently, there are three generations of EC in the US market (2). First-generation devices: Regular cigarettes and  consisting of small lithium  batteries and cartridges (preï¬lled with a liquid that bathes the atomizer) with  disposable or rechargeable batteries. Second-generation devices: Higher-capacity lithium batteries and atomizers  with the ability to reï¬ll them with liquid with atomizers with change in the head . Third-generation devices (Mods): Large-capacity lithium batteries with  integrated circuits that allow vapers to change the voltage or power (wattage)  delivered to the atomizer. These devices can be combined with either  second-generation atomizers or with rebuildable atomizers with consumersâ  ability to prepare their own setup of resistance and wick (2).1. Introduction 2. Background and mechanismEC safety assessment can be evaluated in three steps in US: Chemical studies evaluate the chemical composition of liquids and aerosols.  These studies analyze environmental exposure (passive âvapingâ). Exposure to  toxic chemicals from EC is far lower than tobacco cigarettes reported in several  studies. Besides comparing the levels of speciï¬c chemicals released from tobacco  and EC, it should be taken into consideration that the vast majority of the >4000  chemicals present in tobacco smoke are completely absent from EC (1). 3.1. Chemical Studies   Toxicological evaluation of each of the ingredients of EC (e.g., nicotine, glycerol,  propylene glycol, ï¬avors, metals) and the mixture of the ingredients in the  e-liquid and aerosol produced from the ENDS should be evaluated. Information  concerning substances that may be solvent extractable from the container  closure system or leachable into the e-liquid when the e-liquid is in contact with  the container closure system should be evaluated (2). Toxicological endpoints such  as cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and respiratory, cardiac,  reproductive, and developmental toxicity need to be taken into consideration (2)   Based on the toxicological studies conducted so far, results have shown  signiï¬cantly lower adverse eï¬ects of EC vapor compared with cigarette smoke.  However, no comparison with tobacco smoke was performed in any of these  studies, and they cannot be considered relevant to EC use since the samples were  not tested in the form consumed by vapors. More research is needed on EC,  including studies on diï¬erent cell lines, such as lung epithelial cells. In addition,  evaluating a huge number of liquids with diï¬erent ï¬avors is probably necessary  since a minority of them appear to raise some concerns when tested in the  aerosol form produced by using an EC device (1).3.2.Toxicological Studies 3.1   Chemical Studies   3.2   Toxicological Studies  3.3   Clinical studies 3. Safety & Risk assessment of EC in US Clinical studies are very informative in evaluating in vivo eï¬ects on humans,  which also helps monitor hundreds of users for many years to adequately explore  the products' safety proï¬le under investigation. Therefore, instead of conducting  clinical studies that span months or years to evaluate potential clinical impact,  information on possible long-term health impact by including existing longer  duration studies in the public literature  with the appropriate bridging  information and extrapolating from short-term studies can be provided for  clinical assessments (1).3.3.Clinical studies   Literature searches and monitoring are primarily intended to identify single case  reports of adverse eï¬ects and to track any changes in beneï¬t-risk proï¬les  associated with the chemicals, particularly when new safety concerns arise.  Literature monitoring includes published articles, articles, and reviews in indexed  or non-indexed journals, any content posted anywhere online, posters and  conference abstracts, etc .  Best Practices for literature monitoring techniques includes : A drug safety expert with experience researching literature is needed. Conduct risk assessments to ensure that the search criteria are robust and  relevant to the objective of the literature search. Conduct literature searches and evaluate the results for literature per regional  requirements (Global and Local). Literature search and review is therefore a critical activity that we in Clinchoice  undertake for the safety proï¬ling of drugs.4. Literature monitoringBased on the existing evidence, EC use is by far a less harmful alternative to  smoking. There is no tobacco and no combustion involved in EC use; therefore,  regular vapor may not contain several harmful toxic chemicals that are typically  present in the smoke of tobacco cigarettes. Indeed, some toxic chemicals are  released in the EC vapor as well, but their levels are substantially lower compared  with tobacco smoke. EC are a revolutionary product in tobacco harm reduction.  Although they emit vapor, which resembles smoke, there is literally no ï¬re  (combustion) and no âï¬reâ (suspicion or evidence that they may be the cause for  disease in a similar way to tobacco cigarettes). Due to their unique  characteristics, EC represent a historical opportunity to save millions of lives and  signiï¬cantly reduce the burden of smoking-related diseases worldwide (2).5.

They have many types of usage. For instance, some  drug-device combinations, such as metered-dose inhalers, are used to ensure the  proper dosage of self-administrated medicines outside the clinical environment. The  constituent parts of the Combination Products can be combined in diï¬erent ways. The  intended use of the ï¬nal combination product leads to varying categorizations in  diï¬erent regulatory regions (Table 1). Table 1: Deï¬nition and Categories of Combination Products in the US and the EU  jurisdictions Terminology US FDAiiEUi Brief summary of  deï¬nitionsAccording to Section 503(g)  of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR  3.2 (e), a Combination  product is a product that is  composed of any  combination of a drug and a  device; a biological product  and a device; a drug and a  biological product; or a  drug, device, and a  biological product.  Biological products may  include human cells, tissues,  and cellular-tissue-based  products (HCT/P).According to EU MDR  2017/745, Combination  Products combine a  medicinal product or  substance and a medical  device.FigureÂ 1: Possible Constituent Parts of Combination Products Drug,Device  and Biologic Combination  Products(FDA)Drug and  DeviceDevice and  Biologic Drug and  Biologic 1Categories Integral, Co-packed, and  Referenced  MDR Article 1 (8)(9)(10)Terminology US FDAiiEUi Single-entity, Co-packaged,  and Cross-labelled  21 CFR 3.2(e)(1)(2)(3)(4) Single Entity vs. Integral Co-PackagedDevices that, when placed  on the market,  incorporate, as an integral  part, a substance that, if  used separately, would be  considered a medicinal  product. Example: drug-eluting  stent.  Also, devices intended to  administer a medicinal  product, where the device and the medicinal  product are placed on the  market in such a way that  they form a single integral  product intended  exclusively for use in the  given combination and  which is not reusable.  Examples: Single-use  pre-ï¬lled injectors,  drug-releasing  intra-uterine devices, and  dry-powder inhalers which  cannot be reï¬lled. If a medicinal product and a  medical device are packed  together into a single pack,  it is called Co-Packaged. Example: Spoons/syringes  packaged with medicine A Combination Product has  two or more regulated  components that are  physically, chemically, or  otherwise combined or  mixed and produced as a  single entity.  Examples: A drug-eluting  stent, a catheter with  anti-microbial coating, a  monoclonal antibody  combined with a drug, a  condom with spermicide,  and a pre-ï¬lled insulin  injector pen. Co-Packaged Combination  Products are two or more  separate products (drug/  device, device/biologic, or  drug/biologic) packaged  together in a single package  or as a unit. 2Cross-labeled vs.  ReferencedMedicinal products, where  the product information  refers to a speciï¬c medical  device to be used with the  medicinal product, and the  medical device is obtained  separately by the user of  the medicinal product, it is  called as referenced. Example:  Reï¬llable/reusable injector  referenced to be used with  insulin.A drug, device, or biological  product packaged  separately that, according  to its investigational plan or  proposed labeling, is  intended for use only with  an approved individually  speciï¬ed drug, device, or  biological product where  both are required to achieve  the intended use,  indication, or eï¬ect and  where, upon approval of the  proposed product, the  labeling of the approved  product would need to be  changed.  Example: To reï¬ect a  change in intended use,  dosage form, strength,  route of administration, or  signiï¬cant change in dose. Also, any investigational  drug, device, or biological  product packaged  separately that according to  its proposed labeling is for  use only with another  individually speciï¬ed  investigational drug, device,  or biological product where  both are required to achieve  the intended use,  indication, or eï¬ect. Example: Photosensitizing  drug and activating light  source/laser.for the administration of  that medicine.Example: Drug or vaccine  vial packaged with a  delivery device, ï¬rst-aid kits  containing drugs (antibiotic  ointments, pain relievers,  etc.), and devices  (bandages, gauge, etc.)Terminology US FDAiiEUi 3BackgroundAs shown in Table 1, the description of Combination Products is not as elaborate in the  EU regulation as in the US regulation. EU regulation has recently started considering  Combination Products as a separate group a/f_ter the release of MDR 2017/745. That, too,  EU MDR mentions only Drug Device Combination Products (DDCs).  The broad categorization of Combination Products remains the same across the  jurisdictions. However, the deï¬nitions and terminologies used in diï¬erent regulatory  regions can vary. Combining a drug/biologic with a medical device has been shown to  increase the eï¬ciency and safety of the producti resulting in increased innovation and  product registration. Per the EMA's annual report in 2019iii,  25% of the approved  medicines included a device component. However, there are legal, regulatory, and  scientiï¬c concerns related to combining diï¬erent medical products and technologies.  These products require greater coordination and communication among stakeholders.  Hence, regulations across the globe are also evolving continuously in response to the  rapid growth in this ï¬eld. These regulations can become complex as they diï¬er  signiï¬cantly across jurisdictions. The article focuses on Combination Products with a medical device as a constituent part  and presents an overview of the current regulatory pathways for marketing approval in  two diï¬erent regulatory regions: The US and the EU. The article also discusses the  post-marketing regulatory requirements and the current challenges that the  manufacturers of this group of products may face in the changing regulatory landscape. The regulation in the EU, especially for Combination Products, is still in a nascent stage.  However, in the US, the concept of these products was introduced almost half a century  ago. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed regulations for  Combination Products in the 1970siv.  These Combination Products included  radio-biologics and in-vitro diagnostics. In 1990, the Safe Medical Devices Act (SMDA)  was adopted, which designated the primary jurisdiction of the FDA for regulating  Combination Products. The 21 CFR Part 3 was also introduced around the same time (in  1991). Eventually, SMDA fell under the FDA Modernization Act (FDAMA), which was  enacted in 1997. However, some industry-perceived shortcomings in the FDAMA had  the potential for disputes or disagreementsv  related to Combination Products.  4Current status of the regulatory requirementsHence, the Oï¬ce of Combination Products (OCP) was establishediv in 2002 as required  by Section 204 of the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002  (MDUFMA) to address the unique challenges related to Combination Products. A/f_ter  two years of the birth of the OCP, the dra/f_t Current Good Manufacturing Practices  (cGMP) for Combination Products was made available (in 2004) to guide the industry  and FDA staï¬ in achieving compliance with the applicable cGMPs for the biological  product, device, or drug constituents of Combination Products as well as for the  ï¬nished Combination Product. The dra/f_t cGMP was ï¬nalized in 2013 (codiï¬ed in 21 CFR  Part 4) a/f_ter taking inputs and suggestions from stakeholders and experts. Section 3038  of the 21st Century Cures Act, enacted in December 2016, substantially amended  section 503(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 USC 353(g)),  the principal section of the FD&C Act addressing Combination Products.iv Though the regulation of Combination Products is comparatively new in the EU, the  regulatory approach adopted is based on a more detailed classiï¬cation of Combination  Products compared to the US. Article 117 of the EU MDR 2017/745 has amended  Directive 2001/83/EC governing medicinal products for human use and has introduced  additional requirements for Combination Products. Table 2: Comparison of the US and the EU approval processes for combination products Assessment of  Combination ProductsApplication for a  combination product is ï¬led  to EMA with either a  Declaration of Conformity  (OR) Certiï¬cate of  Conformity (OR) Notiï¬ed  body Opinion that the  device part complies with  the relevant general safety  and performance  requirements of MDR. Based  on the PMOA, the risk class  of the product is assessed.  Notiï¬ed body involvement is  required for assessing Application for a  Combination Product is ï¬led  to an appropriate lead  center which the OCP  assigns for every  Combination Product. The  lead center could be any  one of the three divisions of  the FDA (CDER, CBER, and  CDRH) based on which  constituent part provides  the primary mode of action  (PMOA) of the Combination  Product. Approval Process US EU 5Assessment of  Combination Productsthe device part, except for  Class I devices  (non-measuring,  non-reusable, non-sterile).   Marketing Approval Each constituent part of a  DDC goes through the  approval process as  applicable.Irrespective of PMOA, each  constituent part is assessed.Approval Process US EU Regulatory Requirements  for investigational  applicationSuppose the action of the  medicinal product  (including a product  derived from human blood  or human plasma) is  ancillary to that of the  device. In that case, the  PMOA is attributable to  the device, and the  Combination Product is  assessed as a Class III  device. If the action of the  medicinal product is  principal, the integral  Combination Product is  governed by Directive  2001/83/EC or Regulation  (EC) No 726/2004. The  device part goes through  conformity assessment as  per MDR 2017/745.If PMOA is attributable to  the drug/biologic, an  Investigational new drug  application (IND) is  submitted. If PMOA is attributable to  the device, Investigational  device exemption (IDE) is  submitted.â¢ â¢  â¢ â¢  6Requirement for  submission of regulatory  applications for marketing  approvalInformation on the safety  and eï¬ectiveness of each  component of the  Combination Product.

This includes  the manufacturing  process, applicable  controls, and usability  data Depending on the risk  class of the medical  device constituent, a  Declaration of  Conformity by the  manufacturer or a  relevant certiï¬cate by a  notiï¬ed body or notiï¬ed  body opinion is required.If PMOA is attributable to  the drug, submission to  CDER o New drug application     (NDA) or  o Abbreviated new drug     application (ANDA)  If PMOA is attributable to  biologic, submission to  CBER o Biologic license     application (BLA) If PMOA is attributable to  a device, submission to  CDRH o Premarket Approval     (PMA) application o  De Novo designation o  Pre-market notiï¬cation      (510 (k))Approval Process US EU Information Center EMA develops guidance  documents to guide  applicants in providing  consistent and complete  information in a submission.OCP develops  guidance/regulations for the  applicants.â¢ â¢  â¢  o o â¢ â¢  â¢  7Regulatory pathway in the USThe regulatory pathway to marketing authorization of a Combination Product is more  diï¬cult in the EU compared to the US, as a single marketing approval application is  usually suï¬cient for a Combination Product in the US. The OCP works as a facilitator or a primary focal point for the FDA agencies, consumers,  and the industry in the US. The OCP usually assigns one lead center (CDRH, CDER, or  CBER) based on the PMOA of the Combination Product rather than multiple centers to  help avoid unnecessary duplications and streamline the review and reporting process.  As per 21 CFR Part 3, PMOA is the single mode of action of the Combination Product  that provides its most important therapeutic actionvi. So, in the US, if the PMOA of a OCP Centers for Combination Product Review and ReportingGuidance Documents for  ApplicantsPublicly available guidance  documents can be  downloaded from  https://www.ema.europa.e u/en/documents/scientiï¬c -guideline/guideline-qualit y-documentation-medicin al-products-when-used-m edical-device-ï¬rst-version _en.pdf. and Guidance - MDCG  endorsed documents and  other guidance (europa.eu)All guidance documents for  Combination Products are  publicly available on FDA's  website and can be  downloaded from  https://www.fda.gov/combi nation-products/guidance- regulatory-information/co mbination-products-guidan ce-documentsApproval Process US EU OCP CDRH: Center for Devices  & Radiological Health â¢510( k) â¢PMA â¢IDE â¢Denovo Classiï¬caï¿½on CDER: Center for Drug  Evaluaï¿½on & Research â¢NDA â¢ANDA â¢IND CBER: Center for  Biologics Evaluaï¿½on &  Research â¢BLA 351a 351k- - IND 8FigureÂ 2: Lead Centers of Oï¬ce of Combination Productsdrug/device Combination Product is attributable to the device, the lead center  responsible for pre-market review would be the Center for Device and Radiological  Health (CDRH). If the review of a Combination Product needs the involvement of more  than one FDA center, the OCP uses an algorithm for center assignment. This is based  on the expertise of a center in evaluating the safety and eï¬ectiveness of a similar type  of Combination Product. In the EU, each constituent part of the DDC (integral with the medicinal product as  PMOA or co-packaged or referenced) must go through the approval process. However, if  the medicinal product has ancillary action, the Combination Product will be assessed  and authorized as per MDR 2017/745. The level of regulatory scrutiny will depend on the  risk associated with the product, which will depend on the product's intended purpose.  In addition, the assessment of these products also considers the quality aspects of a The OCP does not review the marketing applications, but it can be requested to be part  of the regulatory meetings with the reviewersvii.  It also plays an important part in  resolving disputes related to the timeliness of pre-market review and pre-market  review decisions on a Combination Product.vii  In addition, OCP ensures patients' safety  by setting guidelines and providing training (to industry and FDA staï¬) on the  consistency and appropriateness of post-market activities required for such  products.viii  One can reach the OCP through the mail, email, or faxvii to submit a request  for designation (RFD), as per the deï¬ned process in 21 CFR Part 3, to obtain a binding  classiï¬cation or lead center assignmentix. A lead center is assigned within 60 days of  RFD ï¬ling. In 2011, FDA released a guidance document for the industry regarding the  type of information the manufacturers should submit to help OCP determine the  regulatory identity or classiï¬cation of a product and, if applicable, assign the  appropriate lead agency for review and regulation. The RFD should be submitted  before ï¬ling any investigational or marketing applications to the FDA.  Alternatively, a manufacturer may submit a pre-RFD to obtain preliminary, informal,  and non-binding feedback on the classiï¬cation and to address jurisdictional issues.   The sponsors are free to propose the classiï¬cation and assignment they believe should  apply to their product for a pre-RFD and are required to do so for an RFD. However, the  OCP makes the ï¬nal decision with input from the relevant divisions of the FDA.  However, submitting RFD/pre-RFD is not mandatory if the manufacturer is clear about  the classiï¬cation of the product.   Regulatory pathway in the EU 9device and the use of the device with the medicinal product, including the impact of  the device on the medicinal product. For example, if a medical device is intended to  administer a speciï¬c medicine, it must be ensured that the device component doesn't  adversely impact the characteristics of the medicine. Under the general rule, an  application for marketing approval for an integral Combination Product must contain  suï¬cient evidence demonstrating that the medical device constituent of the product  complies with the relevant general safety and performance requirements (GSPRs) of  MDR 2017/745. Notiï¬ed body involvement may or may not be required depending on  the class of the medical device. Moreover, for a non-integral Combination Product, the  device constituent must carry a CE mark. The information contained in the submission  concerning the manufacturing process, applicable controls, and usability should be  suï¬cient for the regulating authority to assess the safety and performance-related  factors. For instance, the applicant should provide detailed information about the  platform used and justiï¬cation for its users based on the product's intended purpose.i  In the EU, the devices are also required to indicate clearly on the label that they  incorporate medicinal substances, human blood, or plasma derivatives. As there are no  harmonized ISO standards for the Combination Product-related symbols, the European  trade association has released a guide of symbols to comply with this requirement.xiii   The EU legal framework for Combination Products is based majorly on Directive  2001/83/EC (for medicinal products for human use), Regulation 726/2004/EC (for  authorization and supervision of medicinal products for human and vet use), and  Regulation 2017/745 (for medical devices) which amends Directive 2001/83/EC. In  summary, the approach for Combination Products adopted in the EU is based on a  slightly more detailed classiï¬cation of such products than the FDA approach.i  For the post-marketing regulatory requirements, the EU has yet to come up with  clariï¬cations on the speciï¬c post-marketing regulations for Combination Products,  while FDA has ï¬nalized a rule which was prepared in consultation with various  stakeholders. The main objective of the rule was to provide consistency in the Post  Market Surveillance Report (PMSR) requirements and to avoid unnecessary duplicate  reporting. At the same time, the promotion and protection of public health remained  the primary focus.xiv Safety reporting requirements for marketed products 10The following are the highlights of the PMSR rule:  Standard deï¬nitions such as Combination Product applicant, constituent part  applicant, device application, biological product deviation report (BPDR),  correction and removal report, product development protocol (PDP), etc., have  been given by the FDA for a better understanding of the relevant terms for all such  submission types. The rule clariï¬es the diï¬erence between Application Type - Based Reporting  Requirements and Constituent Part-Based Reporting Requirements This rule also clariï¬es which PMSR requirements apply for which of the  constituents of Combination Products. In addition, it clariï¬es that duplicate  reporting for the same event is not required. The rule considers that a substantial number of small entities are involved in a  Combination Product lifecycle and commits that compliance with the rule would  not have a signiï¬cant economic impact on the small entities.  If two entities A and B are jointly manufacturing a Combination Product, then both  A and B will be subjected to provisions of this rule; however, there are provisions to  avoid duplicate reporting. For instance, the constituent part applicants need to  share the information on death or serious injury within the reporting period  speciï¬ed for that type of event. One of them can submit the combined report to  the FDA.  In addition to application type-based reporting requirements, the Combination  Product applicant is required to submit reports to the FDA following timelines  associated with the report type. If a Combination Product Applicant markets the  constituent parts of the Combination Product under separate applications, the  Combination Product Applicant must comply with the PMSR requirements  associated with each application type. xvi â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ 11Field alert  report (FAR)Required only  when the drug is  one of the  constituents.Within 3  working days Fi/f_teen-day  report and *Follow-up  reportRequired  irrespective of  the type of  constituents15 calendar days  if PMOA is  biologic or drug,  30 calendar  days if PMOA is  a deviceRequired for  serious and  unexpected  events Biological  product  deviation  reporting  (BPDR)Required only  when biologic is  one of the  constituentsWithin 45  calendar daysRequired for a  deviation from a  cGMP, applicable  regulations, applicable  standards,  established  speciï¬cations, orRequired for any  incident that  causes the  product or its  labeling to be  mistaken for, or  applied to  another  product, or any  incident  concerning any  bacteriological  contamination,  or any  signiï¬cant chemical,  physical, or  other change or  deterioration in  the distributed  product or failure to  meet  speciï¬cationsAt least 10 years  as per the  requirements  for medicinal  products or at  least 2 years  beyond the  expected life of  the device  (whichever is  longer).

Note: Some of the reporting requirements mentioned in the table may not apply if the event occurs  outside the US. For foreign events, applicants should contact the Lead Center or OCP as needed. Current challenges It may not be possible to determine PMOA for some Combination Products as the two  constituents may have independent modes of action. Currently, OCP coordinates with  two diï¬erent lead centers in such cases. However, this may cause confusion regarding  the regulatory requirements for the speciï¬c Combination Product. When more than one  center is involved in the review process, the eï¬ectiveness of cooperation among the  involved parties plays a critical role in determining the eï¬ectiveness of the review. In  such cases, guidance from regulatory authorities/experts may be solicited for the type  of marketing application requirement. Currently, separate marketing applications for  individual constituents of a Combination Product are also permissible as per the FD&C  Act, 503(g)(6). For investigational Combination Products, typically, an Investigational New Drug (IND)  application is submitted if the Combination Product has a drug or biologic PMOA, and an  Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) is submitted if the Combination Product has a  device PMOA. However, if both the combination's constituents (drug/biologic and  device) are on the market individually and the RFD has been submitted for the  Combination Product, will IND or IDE still be required? An applicant may discuss such  issues with the regulatory authority (OCP in the US) to get assistance in understanding  the regulatory nature of the Combination Product to determine the right pathway for  marketing authorization.Marketing authorization challenges in the US 14In the EU, all the constituents of the DDC product need to go through the approval  process as per MDR 2017/745. Hence, a Combination Product needs to undergo two  types of assessments: One independent assessment of the medical device as well as the  drug and the other to assess the device's impact on the drug's safety and eï¬cacy. In  addition, no medical device can be grandfathered in the EU. Even if the Combination  Product is on the market for a long time, the economic operators must ensure that it  conforms to the current regulation. It indicates that any change in the packaging of  medical products may lead to new regulatory requirements. For instance, if the  packaging of a drug is changed in a way that it is marketed as a single entity with a  dispenser, then the product may fall under the Combination Product category. Also,  where a device part is replaced, or a new device is added, a new EU declaration of  conformity/EU certiï¬cate may be required as part of a variation or extension  application.  Article 117 of MDR 2017/745 adds a new requirement of the notiï¬ed body opinion for the  device part of an Integral drug-device Combination Product. The new requirement will  apply according to the product's risk classiï¬cation. An EU certiï¬cate issued by Notiï¬ed  Body for a device part must be provided in MAA. A manufacturer should seek a notiï¬ed  body opinion if the EU certiï¬cate is unavailable. Then a notiï¬ed body opinion report will  be issued, and it must be submitted during MAA. For Class I (non-sterile,  non-measuring, and non-reusable) devices, the applicant should provide a Declaration  of Conformity while submitting the MAA  (NB opinion is not required).Marketing authorization challenges in the EU Risk classiï¬cation Requirement According to Article 117 15Figure 3: EU MDR Requirement: Article 117 Arï¿½cle 117 CE marked device A manufacturer should demonstrate the  Declaraï¿½on of Conformity (OR) an EU  cerï¿½ï¬cate should be issued by a noï¿½ï¬ed  body Non CEmarked Device A manufacturer should seek Noï¿½ï¬ed  body opinion on the Conformity of the  consï¿½tuent part of the device which is in  compliance withGSPRAs per Rule 14 of the MDR, incorporating a medicinal substance (including human blood  or plasma derivative) into a device, where the action of the medicinal substance is  ancillary to the device, puts it at the highest risk. Hence, all such medical devices are  considered Class III medical devices, irrespective of their invasiveness or duration of use.  These Combination Products must fulï¬ll more comprehensive conformity assessment  requirements for marketing authorizations.  Suppose the Combination Product is categorized as Class III under Rule 14 and the device  part is implantable, or the device part is Class IIb; in this case, it needs to undergo extra  scrutiny of the clinical evaluation consultation procedure by the independent expert  panel. In addition, all the devices incorporating a medicinal product need to seek a  scientiï¬c opinion from the medicinal product authority. No justiï¬cation can replace the  scientiï¬c opinion as per MDR 2017/745. The possible implication could be that despite  complying with all stringent conformity assessment requirements for devices, the  Combination Product may not get a certiï¬cate from the notiï¬ed body if the scientiï¬c  opinion is unfavorable. Suppose the PMOA is a drug for a drug-device combination, and the device constituent  falls under high-risk device due to its invasiveness or implantable nature; in this case, the  product will take the marketing route as a drug complying with the Medicinal Product  Directive (MPD). Still, the device part must also comply with appropriate conformity  assessments required for a high-risk device. In this evolving phase, when regulations for devices have become stricter, and the  number of notiï¬ed bodies has not increased proportionately, there is a signiï¬cant amount  of confusion related to the Combination Products. Getting a Combination Product on the  market has become prolonged and more burdensome. The notiï¬ed bodies are under  tremendous time pressure for quality review. As drug manufacturers are also supposed to  go through the device approval process for their Combination Products, the burden on  the already burdened notiï¬ed bodies will increase multifold. EMA released Guidelines on  Combination Products (refer to Table 2) to help the applicants.   The applicant may contact the authorities responsible for medical devices to get  additional clariï¬cations on the product's regulatory status because general principles  may not apply to all the products. The Combination Products are complex; hence,  safety and eï¬ectiveness need to be assessed on a case-to-case basis. The  manufacturers should engage in early dialogue with the concerned regulators. It is important to understand what cannot be included as a Combination Product to  avoid further confusion regarding the categorization and classiï¬cation of products. 16Certain medical products are used in combination with each other. Hence, they may be  mistaken for combination products. For example, syringes are primarily used to deliver a  drug. However, unless it is speciï¬ed on the label that the syringe can be used only with a  speciï¬c drug, the syringe and the drug are not considered a Combination Product. Suppose a medical product is used with a non-medical product; it doesnât fall under the  Combination Product category - for example, a drug with a food supplement or a device  with cosmetics. Moreover, suppose the same medical products (drug/drug or  device/device) are used together; they do not fall under the Combination Product  category, such as ï¬xed-dose drug combinations. In addition, each regulatory jurisdiction has its deï¬nition of a Combination Product. For  example, a drug and biologic combination is not considered a Combination Product in  the EU region.What is not a combination product? Combination Productsâ regulations have been introduced to overcome the challenges in  inventing, developing, manufacturing, and approval processes. Because of the increased  safety and convenient use of Combination Products, the demand for such products is  increasing. However, the Combination Products are complex and may deploy new  methods and innovative technologies. The regulatory assessment of such products aims  to ensure users' safety while supporting innovation. As the number of diï¬erent types of  Combination Products is increasing, the regulation for such products is also evolving. Moreover, diï¬erent countries have diï¬erent regulations and deï¬nitions that add to the  already existing challenges for the manufacturers. Hence, Combination Product  manufacturers must understand and comply with the relevant regulatory requirements  and remain vigilant about regulatory changes that could impact their product. A good  understanding of the safety and eï¬cacy proï¬le of a Combination Product, as well as  relevant regulations, will lead to the successful marketing of the product and technical  success for patient treatment.Conclusion 17A multidisciplinary team with varied and extensive knowledge regarding regulations and  nuances in diï¬erent markets is a necessity for a successful application. Regulatory  strategists with experience making submissions FDA and EMEA, must work  collaboratively with skilled and knowledgeable medical writers, toxicologists, and  clinical teams to submit high-quality submissions to health authorities. A robust quality  management system is necessary to ensure all checkpoints are reviewed for consistency  and accuracy within the time permitted by the regulatory calendar.Preparing for Combination Product Registrations 18References: i.Guideline on quality documentation for medicinal products when used with a medical  device.

Microbiota   refers to the community of microorganisms present in species such as humans. The m icrobiome  is the collective genomes of all the microorganisms present in a species [2].   The alterations in the functional metabolites generated from gut  microbiota play an essential   role in the pathogenesis of various human ailments ; for example , lipopolysaccharides (LPS)  and  peptidoglycan  are the metabolites generated from  gut microbiota that act as pro -inflammatory  agents  [3]. The short -chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids modulate the secretion of glucagon - like peptide (GLP -1), which is linked to insulin secretion and glucose metabolism  [4]. The  tryptophan metabolites , such as indole -3-acetic acid and indole -3-propionic acid , are linked to  immunity and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  [5]. The bacterial metabolite trimethylamine N - oxide (TMAO) formed from choline and L -carnitine directly corre lates  with incidences of  cardiovascular diseases  [6]. The gut bacterial fermentation products of protein , such as  polyamines and N -nitroso compounds , are known to exert carcinogenic potential  [7]. In addition,  gut microbiome -metabolized  products are considered essential  sources of fat-soluble vitamins   (thiamine, riboflavin, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 , among others ) and micro nutrients  (vitamin A,  vitamin D, iron, and zinc, among others ). They  are known to be pivotal in the central nervous  system by acting as neurotransmitters or precursors [8]. Thus, the gut microbiota has a profound  role in the health and disease of animals and humans . Any alterations in the gut  microbiota can  lead to systemic alterations in different pathologies , as highlighted in a few examples above.  However, so far , there is no provision or consideration for evaluating the impact of xenobiotics ,  such as pharmaceuticals , on the normal gut  microbiota and associated health complications, both  in the pre -clinical and clinical phases of development. With this background, this article focuse s  on leveraging gut microbiota's impact on health and disease  and its considerations in the  toxicological risk assessment of various xenobiotics intended for human use , such as  pharmaceuticals .  IMPORTANCE OF MICROBIOTA IN HEALTH   The m icrobiome is coevolved in humans and healthy individuals . The microbiome is said to be in  the symbiosis or eubiosis state, in which the microbiome is intact with its functions , such as  digestion and absorption of food and xenobiotics, eliciting the im mune response, protecting the  body from external microorganisms, and producing the essential metabolites required for  normal  functioning of the  body  [9]. Any alterations in the normal microbiota are called dysbiosis, which  is scientifically well-established for being  linked with various disease states such as inflammatory   bowel di seases (IBS)  [10, 5] , neuro psychiatric  disorders [11, 12] , cancers  [13, 14] , cardio - metabolic disorders [15, 16, 17] , liver diseases [18, 19]  and so on.   Furthermore, a n experimental study was performed  using young (3 months), old (18 months) ,  and aged male C57BL/6J mice (24 months)  to explore the role of gut  microbiota on the gut-brain   axis, gut -retinal axis , and associated inflammatory pathways . Initially , fecal  pellets were collected  from all the animals , and the inherent gut microbiota associated with the animals were depleted  Page 4 of 12   by giving a cocktail  of broad -spectrum  antibiotics  orally for three  days  (100 Î¼L  each of vancomycin  5 mg/mL , metronidazole, 10 mg/mL , ampicillin 1 000mg /L, neomycin 5 00 mg/L). The fecal  pellets  collected from these mice (young, old, and aged) before  antibiotic treatment ( Baseline or Pre- Abx) were used to prepare the fecal  slurry , which is used for the fecal  microbial transfer ( FMT ).  The fecal  samples collected at baseline ( pre-Abx), post -anti-biotic ( post-Abx) treatment , and  post -FMT were subjected to metabolomic analysis  [20].   The results revealed t hat post -Abx, the aged animals developed retinal and CNS inflammation  through alterations in the gut  microbiota and associated detrimental effects on the gut-brain  axis  and gut -retinal axis ; surprisingly , these pathological changes noticed in the aged  animals were  rever sed upon doing FMT from the young animals. On the other hand, upon doing FMT from  aged animals, the normal healthy young animals developed CNS and retinal inflammation  through alterations in  the gut  microbiota [20]. Thus, this experiment demonstrated that age- related changes in the gut  microbiota  have a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of CNS and retinal  inflammation.    GUT MICROBIOME -MEDIATED TOXICITY   The toxicity associated with gut  microbiome or chemical -gut microbial interactions is broadly  classified into two types 1) toxicant modulation of the microbiome (TMM) and 2) microbiome  modulation of the toxicant (MMT) . The changes in the microbiota after expos ure to the test  substance are called TMM . At the same time,  the biotransformation of the exposed chemical ,  either more or less toxic, in the presence of microbial enzymes or microbial metabolites , is  termed MMT. In MMT, different groups of bacterial metabo lizing enzymes have been discovered ,  such as Î²-lyases, sulfatases, Î²-glucuronidases, nitro -reductases, and azo -reductases. They have   unique roles in the metabolic modifications of test chemicals.     The evidence suggests that gut  microbiota metabolizes the xenobiotics more extensively and  effectively than any other organ system in the body . Hence, microbiota -mediated enzymatic  modifications of the test chemical are considered the first mechanism by which toxicity of a  xenobiotic is induced either more or les s. The o ther one i s bioavailability . The gut microbiome  has a significant role in the absorption of xenobiotics and , therefore, is considered a deciding  factor in the induction of toxicity in the host [21].    One of the classic examples of microbiome -modulated  toxicity is cyclamate -induced  carcinogenicity. Cyclamate is one of the widely used artificial sweetener s in Europe. However, it  was banned in the UK and US due to the carcin ogenic potential of one of its metabolite s named ,  cyclohexamine. In  an ex vivo  experiment, various tissues were pre -incubated with cyclamate to  see the conversion ; interesting ly, the conversion of cyclamate to cyclohexamine was evident only  in the lower gu t contents, and the conversion was negligible in other tissues , including the liver,  kidney, spleen, and blood . In support of this, a n in vivo  study conducted on rats using radio - labeled cyclamate  revealed similar results. In another  experiment , rats were administered  cyclamate in drinking water for several months, and the rats bec ame converters ; however, the  conversion ability was lost when antibiotics were co -administered along with cyclamate [21, 23,  Page 5 of 12   24]. Thus, all the available evidence strong ly suggests that gut microbiota  has a significant  role in the formation of cyclohexamine  from cyclamate . Hence , the gut microbiota  has a pivotal role in cyclamateâs carcinogenicity .    Table 1. Examples of gut-microbiome -mediated toxicity through TMM and MMT mechanisms.     In this case, the parent chemical was not carcinogenic; however , the gut microbiota  has generated a toxic metabolite from the parent chemical ; it  is an example of microbiome -modulated  toxicity.   Similarly, melamine is used in infant formulas and pet food. In 2008, melamine grabbed  a lot of attention from the media and the public d ue to its  toxic effects , such as mortality and nephrotoxicity in animals and children. The nephrotoxicity was due to one of the toxic metabolite s, âcyanuric  acidâ, formed due to the activity of gut  microbiota. Interestingly, these toxic effects observed in rats were rever sed upon antibiotic administration .  Thus, it was confirmed that the reported toxicity was due to the toxic metabolite formed from melamine rather than melamine a lone. Particularly,  Klebsiella terrigena  has significantly increased the toxic m etabolite formation  from melamine. The renal toxicity of melamine is mediated by the GI  microbiota  [25].   On the other hand, t he TMM is yet another mechanism in which perturbation of the gut microbiome by some toxicant exposure may signif icantly  impact  normal health.  As highlighted earlier, alterations in normal gut flora have been linked to various human ailments. For example, exposure to Examples of gut microbiome -mediated toxicity (MMT) in experimental animals   Xenobiotic  Microbiome -induced alteration  Organism / Test system  Effects   Chloramphenicol  Amine formation  Enterobacteria  Bone marrow aplasia  [27]  Balsalazide  Azoreduction â mesalamine  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  Anorexia, nausea, and skin rash  [28, 29]  Risperidone  Ring cleavage -> 9-hydroxy -risperidone  Rats and dogs  Symptoms of Parkinson âs disease  [30]  Pyrene  Hydroxylation -> 1-hydroxypyrene  Human gut microbiota  Endocrine disruption [31]  Benzo(a)pyrene  Hydroxylation -> 7-hydroxybenzo(a)pyrene  Human gut microbiota  Endocrine disruption  [31]  Nitrazepam  Nitroreduction -> 7-aminonitrazepam  Sprague -Dawley rats  Teratogenic  [32]  Examples of the toxicant -induced altered microbiome (TMM) in experimental animals   Xenobiotic  Toxicant -induced microbiome alteration or  dysbiosis  Test system  Effects   Glyphosate  General gut flora depletion  Mice  Anxiety and depression  [26]  Ethanol   (Oxidative metabolite)  âBacteroides, Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus. â  Streptococcus and other minor species.  Humans  Rectal cancer  [33, 34]  Arsenic  âBacteroidetes and â Firmicutes  IL-10 â/â mice  Dysbiosis of the Gut  [35]   Page 6 of 12       valproic acid, antibiotics, arsenic, lead, cadmium, nickel, and silver nanoparticles has been  scientifically proven to cause alterations in the gut microbiome.   One of the typical examples of TMM is glyphosate -induced toxicity. Glyphosate is one of the most   widely used herbicides for agricultural purposes. It is known to act by inhibiting the shikimic acid  pathway in herbs and is assumed to have extremely low toxicity in animals since this pathway is  absent in animals. However, in experimental studies, glyph osate has caused depression and  anxiety in the experimental animals; mechanism -based studies revealed that gut microbiota has  a shikimic acid pathway, and glyphosate has caused depression and anxiety in animals by causing  dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. T hus, toxicant -induced altered gut microflora significantly  impacts health  [26].   Examples of gut microbiome -mediated toxicity through TMM and MMT mechanisms are  summarized in Table 1.   STRATEGIES FOR CONSIDERATION OF MICROBIOTA IN TOXICOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSM ENTS   It is crucial  to evaluate and understand what the drug/test substance does to the gut microbial  community and what gut microbiota does to the drug/test substance. There are step -by-step  approaches for evaluating gut microbiota -associated toxicities.   The following appro aches can be used to evaluate microbiome -correlated toxicities  [29]:  1. In silico  analysis/ predictions : This can be performed using databases such as t he  Mechanism of Action of the Human Microbiome  (MAHMI), Microbiome Database (MDB),  Human Microbiome Project (HMB), Association Between Microbiota and Disease   (Amadis), Disbiome, microbiota âactive substance interactions  (MASI) and so on.   2. In vitro  cell cultures: The microbial cells isolated from various sites were cultured under  diverse conditions to mimic the gut  microbiome . This test system was used for both MMT  and TMM studies.   3. Pre-clinical testing : This is the most conventional method, which considers all the possible  interactions of the host -microbiome. In this test, the substance -mediated toxicities via  different mechanisms involving the microbiome will be evaluated in experimental  animals.   4. Gnotobiotic animal models: The germ -free animals were infected with the organism of  interest and subjected to testing.   5. Human studies : This involves exposing healthy human volunteers to the test substance  and evaluating the associated health risks mediated through MMT and TMM  mechanisms.   Pertaining to the in vitro  and in vivo  experimental approaches, the fecal samples must be  collected and assessed for abundance and variability in the microbiota to understand the  xenobiotic -induced alterations in gut microbiota and associated effects . Any observed alteration  should be scientif ically correlated for possible adverse reactions or diseases. For example,  overexpression of Fusobacterium nucleatum  bacteria was reported to cause colon tumorigenesis   Page 7 of 12       in rodents , and decreased abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila  was reported in obesity a nd  diabetes, and the la tter was reversed upon supplementing A. muciniphila.    Conversely, pharmacometabolomics/ chemometabolomics  is the branch of metabolomics that  deals with quantifying and analyzing metabolites formed from drugs/chemicals, respectively; t his  helps identify the metabolites, map the metabolic pathways, and explore their possible role in  the drug/chemical -induced toxicities. I f the metabolites formed are well -known, the toxicity  profile can be assessed from the available literature on the met abolites , while in the case of  unknown metabolites , a conventional toxicological risk assessment must be performed for the  new metabolite /s identified  [36]. The Pharmacometabolomics/Chemicometabolomics approach  has been illustrated in Figure 1.     Figure 1. Pharmacometabolomics/Chemicometabolomics approach   CONSIDERATIONS OF MICROBIOTA DURING THE CONDUCT OF TOXICOLOGICAL STUDIES   As highlighted above , gut microbiota may represent substantial and incomprehensible effects in  the in vivo  toxicological assessments. The gut microbiota is one of the possible mechanisms  postulated for the significant variations observed in the animal experimental outcomes , such as  individual -to-individual  and/or study -to-study  variation  [37]. However, despite being a significant  factor in xenobiotics -mediated  toxicity or being a target for xenobiotic -induced toxicity, the gut  microbiota has not been considered while conduct ing toxicity studies, as none of the currently  recommended guidelines or international standards mandates  the consideration of gut  microbiota -related effects  in the design and conduct of pre -clinical studies  and as a part of risk  assessment .    Page 8 of 12       The following ap proaches can be adopted before and during the pre -clinical toxicological  experiments to fill the evidential gap and compensate for the possible variabilities that may arise  from    1]. As much as possible , procure the animals with standardized microbiota . In case it is  unavailable, obtain information on the origin of the species, such as litter, breeding, and  barrier, which  must be considered during the randomization of animals.   2]. Choose the animal model/spe cies with the utmost bacterial diversity comparable to wild  animals.   3]. Routine evaluation of gut microbiota , including the diversity and composition of animals  receiving the xenobiotic treatments during the toxicity studies (before, during, and at  terminatio n)  4]. Evaluation of the impact of the xenobiotics on the gut microbiota and vice versa gives better  clarity to correlate the role of gut microbiota in the toxicity of the xenobiotics on the in vivo   systems     SUMMARY   Based on the available scientific evidence, it can be concluded that gut microbiota has a  significant role in xenobiotic -induced toxicity. However, as of now, the gut microbiota is not  included as a part of toxicity testing either in any guideline or as a requirement in any regulatory  authorities. In the absence of any guidelines and recommendations, the role of gut microbiota  has been overlooked or disregarded.     The inclusion of gut microbiota in toxicological assessments of pharmaceuticals is the need of the  hour. Gut microbiota has a significant role in the quality of life; hence, it must be included in the  toxicological assessments. Further, gut microbiota -related assessments should be included as a  part of regulatory requirements to determine/rule out a ny possibilities of test substance -induced  perturbances of the normal gut microbiome.     Literature Search Strategy:   A detailed literature search was performed using the search term s  âGut microbiota â in combination with âdysbiosis â, âtoxicology ,â âdisorders â, âmechanism â, âtoxicity  testing â, âtoxicology risk assessment â, âstrategies for toxicity testing,â  and so on. in the online  databases such as PubMed/Medline, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. All the articles obtained  from the above databases w ere initially screened with the âabstract â or âfull-length copy, â and  the papers fitting into the criteria were considered. Further, wherever additional data was  required, the cross -references in the papers and reviews were searched.   At Clin Choice, we have  a team of experienced and dedicated toxicologists who are expertise in  the literature search, risk and hazard identification, and preparation of toxicological profiles,  including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and medical devices. Also, we have a team of  experts working on preparing and reviewing non -clinical electronic common technical documents  (eCTD) for botanicals, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals for submission to regulatory approvals   Page 9 of 12       References     [1]  Heijtz Rochellys Diaz et al., "Normal gut microbiota modulates brain development and behavior,"  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 108, no. 7,  pp. 3047 -3052, 2011.

1 Copyright 2022 Medidata Solutions, Inc., a Dassault SystÃ¨mes companyCASE STUDY Optimizing Dire ct-to-Patient S upply  Manag ement: ClinChoice and 89Bio  Case Study PIVOTING TO PRESERVE CONTINUITY OF CARE  The CRO ClinChoice and the sponsor 89Bio were conducti ng a phase II, randomized,  double-blind, placebo-controlled study to explore the efficacy and safety of  investigational drug X in subjects with severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG). The  companies needed to pivot to a decentralized protocol d uring the pandemic or face  trial disruption.  Needing to maintain trial integrity during the COVID-19 pandemic, while prioritizing  patients' safety and their continued participation in the study were key factors to  initiating a Direct-to-Patient (DtP) solution. This allowed the patient to choose to be  dosed on site or at home. However, with 300 sites and 200 patients across both the US and Canada, the trialâs  hybrid approach needed to adhere to differing regulatory guidelines. It also required  the ability to provide flexible dispensation preferences (i.e., home or site based on  each dosing visit), and quick response to remote pat ient needs.    ClinChoice and 89Bio needed a partner that could provi de the ease and flexibility   to rapidly execute DtP, while ensuring Investigational Product (IP) supply  management and optimization.  ClinChoiceâs longtime partnership with Medidata acros s multiple trials and different  solutions earned their trust and confidence, and they engaged Rave RTSMâs DtP  capabilities and professional services to ensure the cli nical trialâs success.

Medidata worked with the Sponsor, CRO, site, and depot to  integrate the DtP system across the entire supply  chain. Its agility to be used in decentralized, hybri d, or on-site trials and flexibility to offer a choice o f  dispensation scenarios, whether at the patient or visit l evel, ensured it met both US and Canadian regulation  requirements, a nd supp orted accelerated pro cesses by automating workflows.  Rave  RTSM enabled the study team to have a f ull overview of all shipments, including  Dt P shipments status  updates for IP at each point. RTSM, like  all soluti ons across the Medidata platform, does not maintain patient  identifiable data, such as patient addresses. This information  is kept outside the system and is managed via direc t  communication between the sites and the depot, removing an o pportunity  fo r a breach of patient identifiable  information (PII). In a changing global landscape, 89BIO and ClinChoice took advantage of the opportunity to explore the us e of  enhanced Rave RTSM DtP technologies, accelerating their own di gital transformation and increasing patient  satisfaction. Keys to DtP Success With guidance and training from Medidataâs Professional Se rvices team, the CRO and Sponsor/Site: Created a connected DtP workflow, providing step- by-step instructions to assign action throughout  the DtP process, eliminating confusion and  margins of error Received training and eLearnings prior  t o RTSM  DtP setup to promote usability a nd compliance Created a dispensation source field  in eCRF (electronic case report for m),  a critical data point to direct IP for a p articular  visitAssigned designated personnel to  trigger dispensation prior to upcomi ng  visits to accelerate data entry of  dispensation source field Used Business ObjectÂ© (BO4)âs daily ad hoc report with enhanced alerts t o the  study team to trigger dispensation,  while also taking tracking  responsibilities

Studies initiated a fter December 17, 2017 will  be required in the same formats for Investigational New Drug Applications  (INDs).1   The FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by ensu ring the safety, efficacy, and  security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, an d medical devices; and by ensuring  the safety of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, and products  that emit radiation. FDA is  responsible for advancing the publ ic health by helping speed in novations that make medical  products more effective, safer, and more affordable and by help ing the public get the accurate,  science-based inform ation they need to use medical products and  foods to maintain and improve  their health.2   The implementation of electronic data standards advances the ag encyâs efforts by enabling more  timely and effective regulatory  reviews of submissions and thei r corresponding data. The FDA has  clearly stated, âData that are not standardized diminish the Ag encyâs ability to review the data  efficiently, resulting in manual, labor-intensive processes and  inherent inefficiencies in the review.  They also limit the ability to a utomate some routine analyses.â3 The standards open up a world of  opportunity in terms of exchanging, reviewing, and sharing data . However, for some sponsors,  they prompt numerous questions about how to plan for and submit  electronic study data packages  to the FDA. This paper will describe the evolution of relevant standards and provide  recommendations for best practi ces in planning and preparing FD A submission data packages.            2   History  In order to understand current s tudy data standards, it is help ful to know a little about the history  of those standards, what has impa c t e d  t h e i r  e v o l u t i o n ,  a n d  t h e  reasons why they have been  implemented.   On March 20, 1997, the FDA published the Electronic Records and  Electronic Signatures  regulation (FDA 21 CFR Part 11). This regulation was significan t because it signaled a real,  practical shift toward electronic submissions and electronic st andards and enabled applicants to  voluntarily submit parts of their r egulatory submissions in ele ctronic format without requiring a  backup paper copy. The regulatio n also spurred additional guida nces and initiatives to support  electronic submissions.   In April of 1998, CDER issued a draft guidance for the industry , Providing Regulatory  Submissions in Electronic Format â NDAs4. This draft guidance bui lt on the September 1997  guidance with information on submitting a complete archival cop y of a New Drug Application  (NDA) in electronic format. Late r in 1998, the FDA Center for B iologics Evaluation and Research  (CBER) published a draft guidance that focused on assisting app licants in submitting electronic  content in the Biologic License Application (BLA) or Product Li cense Application (PLA) and  Establishment License Applicati on (ELA) submission processes5.   In 1999, the FDA CDER and CBER published Guidance for Industry Providing Regulatory  Submissions in Electronic Format â General Considerations6. This joint  guidance captured the  common standards and considerations for all electronic submissi ons and was followed by  guidances that addressed specifi c submission types (NDAs, BLAs,  etc.).  As the FDA began to accept regulat ory submissions in electronic  format, a broader harmonization  initiative brought the common t echnical document (CTD) to the i nternational stage. The CTD was  developed by a working group with in the International Conferenc e on Harmonization (ICH)7. It  defined five discipline-specific modules for a regulatory submi ssion. The first module is region  specific while modules 2 through 5 are common for all regions.          3   Modular Structure of Common Technical Document8    This initiative sought to decrease the time, effort, and redund ancies of submitting regulatory  content to different health authorities around the world by ide ntifying a common structure and set  of content that would be accepted by all ICH members, including  the US, Japan, and the European  Union. As the CTD matured, the electronic Common Technical Docu ment (eCTD) emerged to  support electronic submissions.   As electronic submissions continued to make progress, the Clini cal Data Interchange Standards  Consortium (CDISC) emerged, add ressing the data component of re gulatory submission standards.  CDISC is a global, open, multidi sciplinary, non-profit organiza tion that has estab lished standards  to support the acquisition, excha nge, submission, and archive o f clinical research data and  metadata. The CDISC mission is to develop and support global, p latform-independent data  standards that enable informati on system interoperability to im prove medical research and related  areas of healthcare.9          4   In July 2004, the FDA first referenced the CDISC Study Data Spe cification in an eCTD guidance.  Then, in December of 2006, the agency announced its intention t o make the CDISC Study Data  Tabulation Model (SDTM) required by regulation.   In May 2015, the FDA issued the guidance titled, Providing Regulatory Subm issions in Electronic  Format â Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using  the eCTD Specifications (revision 3)10.   All of these international initiatives grew from a need for ele ctronic standards. Applicants were  initially using no standards or developing their own. Even with in the same company, standards  would vary and this scenario req uired FDA medical and statistic al reviewers to learn each  company-specific or study-specific approach in order to review an NDA or BLA submission. This  presented a significant challenge. Ramp-up time was required fo r each project review and for each  new reviewer added to a project. The added time and resource co sts started to pile up and had a  negative impact on review proce sses and consequently on the tim e required to get new therapies  to patients.   The continued collaboration of ICH, the FDA, and CDISC has enab led the development of  electronic submission standards supported by technical document ation and specifications that are  constantly being refined, updated, and implemented.    CDISC and FDA: Working Together  The FDA and CDISC have a long history of collaboration. Mutual goals have enabled the  organizations to promote, impleme nt, and refine electronic data  standards. CDISC teams typically  consist of volunteers from across the industry focused on the f ollowing:        5   ï· SDS â Submission Data Standards  ï· ADaM â Analysis Data Model  ï· SEND â Standard for Exchange of Non-clinical Data  ï· CDASH â Clinical Data Acquisi tion Standards Harmonization  The teams include FDA observers and are each focused on progres sing specific standards models,  including the development of supporting documentation such as i mplementation guides.   The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act was signed into law in July 2012.  This law expanded the agencyâs authority to collect user fees t o fund product reviews and promote  innovation with the intent of sp eeding patient acc ess to safe a nd effective products. It also includes  the fifth reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act  (PDUFA V). The production of  guidances for the industry on the use of CDISC data standards f or the electronic submission of  study data is included in FDAâs PDUFA goals.11  In December 2014, the FDA issued Providing Regulatory Submission s in Electronic Format â  Standardized Study Data12 along with four technical specifi cations. This binding guidance   describes the requirements for an electronic submission of stan dardized clinical  and nonclinical  study data that use the standard s specified in the Data Standar ds Catalog (Catalog). Technical  specifications are referenced in this guidance document but are  provided as standalone documents  so they can be updated periodically. They include the list belo w and can be accessed on the FDA  website13:  ï· Data Standards Catalog   ï· Study Data Technical Conformance Guide   ï· FDA Specific SEND Validation Rules   ï· FDA Specific SDTM Validation Rules  The Data Standards Catalog lists all supported and required ver sions of standards, their uses, and  start and end dates for FDA support of each standard. It addres ses exchange formats, study data,  and controlled termi nology standards that the FDA can process, review, and archive.        6   The Study Data Technical Conformance Guide replaced the Study D ata Specifications document  and CDERâs Common Data Standards Issues document. It supplement s the guidance and provides  specifications and technical rec ommendations on submitting stan dardized data using those  standards listed in the FDA Data Standards Catalog.   The binding guidance also notes:    ï· The Agency may Refuse-To-File  (RTF) for NDAs and BLAs, or Refuse-To-Receive   (RTR) for ANDAs if an electronic submission does not submit stu dy data in conformance  with the required standards specified in the Catalog.  ï· After the publication of this guidance, all studies with a star t date 24 months  after the  publication date must use the appropriate FDA-supported standar ds, formats, and  terminologies specified in the  Catalog for NDA, ANDA, and certa in BLA submissions and  36 months for IND studies. (This means that most NDA/BLA and AN DA studies  beginning after December 17, 2016 and December 17, 2017 are bou nd by this guidance,  respectively.)   ï· If the application is not submit ted electronically, the sponsor  may receive an RTF or RTR.  The FDAâs electronic submission guidances and regulations, the ICH eCTD specification, and the  CDISC data standards form the foundation for sponsors to submit  regulatory submissions and  supporting data in electronic form at that sustains the receipt and review of information by the  FDA.   Standardized Stu dy Data Package  A standardized study data packag e will include a SEND data pack age, SDTM data package, and  an ADaM data package. Following is  a brief list of the contents  of each package:  SEND Data Package SDTM Data Package ADaM Data Package  ï· acrf.pdf  ï· .xpt files  ï· Define.xml ï· acrf.pdf  ï· .xpt files  ï· Define.xmlï· .xpt files  ï· Define.xml       7   ï· Study Data  Reviewerâs Guide  (nSDRG.pdf)   ï· Study Data  Reviewerâs Guide  (cSDRG.pdf) ï· Analysis Data  Reviewerâs Guide  (ADRG.pdf)    The Study Data Technical Conformance Guide 14 illustrates the standard f older structure for study  datasets along with naming conven tions, and a description of th e contents as seen in the following  graphic:          8    Planning with the End in Mind  The complexity involved in the design and creation of submissio n data packages can be a daunting  task. There are several ways to simplify this endeavor with pro per planning and early  collaboration.   Study Data Standardiz ation Plan (SDSP)  The December 2014 FDA Guidance identified the need for a Study Data Standardization Plan  (SDSP). The plan describes the data standardization approach fo r studies within a development  program. The development of an SDSP can help to facilitate inte rnal discussions on the standards  approach, provides a means of tracking discussions and agreemen ts with the FDA documents on  the rationale for legacy data conversion strategies as well as ongoing studies that support data  pooling.   In developing the SDSP, sponsors should identify what studies w ill be submitted in the required  standards. Studies that will be submitted in legacy study data formats should also be identified. It  is important for sponsor teams t o discuss the rationale and app roach for each study early in the  process to ensure that the data will be presented in the submis sion to support the regulatory review  in the best way possible. If it i s determined that a conversion  is required, it is b etter to know early  in the process and to plan and execute the conversion project w ith adequate time for quality  checking and internal review.   The Pharmaceutical Users Software Exchange (PhUSE) is an indepe ndent, not-for-profit  organization run by volunteers that has developed an SDSP template and implementation guide15.  Both documents have been sent to the FDA for review. These docu ments provide a very general  framework, or foundation, for sponsors to begin to compile thei r study data standardization  information.    Conversion Decisions  Sponsors should discuss legacy data conversions as early in the  process as possible. However,  traceability is critical since th e Clinical Study Report (CSR) may be based on legacy data. Key  data verification with SDTM and ADaM datasets will also be nece ssary. This will also impact the       9   sponsorâs data pooling strategy fo r the Integrated  Summaries of  Safety and Efficacy (ISS/ISE).  Determine and document if you will pool at SDTM or ADaM level, and identify the SDTM and  ADaM versions, WHO drug dictiona ry, and MedDRA dictionary versi ons.   Agency Communications  Standard sponsor/FDA meetings c reate opportunities to discuss t he data standardization plan and  the overall approach with the FD A prior to submission. The plan  should be an official agenda topic  for a scheduled agency meeting. S ponsors may start discussions at the pre-IND stage. For INDs,  the plan should be located in th e general investigational plan.  CDER and CBER have jointly  published recommendations for preparing the plan on the FDA web site16. For Sponsors working  toward an NDA, the plan should be submitted no later than the E nd-of-Phase-II Meeting. The pre- NDA/BLA meeting is considered too  late in the process to allow strategy changes.   eCTD Test Submission  As a sponsor prepares to submit a n electronic regulatory submis sion to the FDA, they can submit  a test submission in advance of t he actual submission. This tes t submission allows the sponsor to  prepare a sample set of data and documents for the FDA for a me aningful, comprehensive analysis  that helps to ensure that the sponsor is able to submit accordi ng to specifications. The test  submission is processed just like a real submission so sponsors  can identify any technical  conformance issues. The test s ubmission content does not go thr ough a regulatory review by the  agency.   Benefits of Implemen ting Data Standards  Compliance is the most important  benefit of implementing data s tandards. An RTF or RTR risks  and delays years of research and development; and can be costly  to remediate. Implementing the  standards early and leveraging mechanisms such as the SDSP and the test submission help  sponsors to develop and articulate their approach to data stand ardization for internal and external  stakeholders.        10  By leveraging FDA supported stan dards, sponsors can also facili tate the review process. FDA  reviewers are trained on current  data standards so they will re quire less support in understanding  the structure/format of CDISC-compliant data sets.   Finally, in 2014, CDISC published a business case17 for data standards based on research  conducted in collaboration with Gartner, Inc., a leading IT res earch and advisory company The  research suggested that communi cation among project team member s and partners was improved,  a greater level of accuracy re quiring less training was achieve d, and decision making was  simplified when data standards we re applied. The implementation  of data standards also facilitated  the transfer of data between partners, while positioning the sp onsor to select from a wider choice  of tools and technologies.   Findings suggest that by using CDISC standards from the start, researchers can save 70-90% of  time and resources during the St udy Start Up stage (time to fir st patient enrolled), and ~ 75% of  non-patient participation time during Study Conduct and Analysi s. The business case also suggests  that standardizing data can shave 2 years off of an average 12 year clinical development program.  Conclusion  A submission data package requi res a significan t amount of inte rnal and external collaboration in  order to identify appropriate data standards, to develop a soli d rationale for the data standards  approach, to gain internal cons ensus, and to implement any requ ired conversions. The FDA is able  to provide valuable input into this discussion and should be us ed as a resource in this planning  stage. Open communication with the FDA will add value throughou t the regulatory review process.                 11  Reference   1 Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format â Submis sions Under Section 745A(a) of the Federal  Food, Drug, and Cosme tic Act, Guidance for Industry, U.S. Depar tment of Health and Hum an Services Food and  Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CD ER), Center for Biologics Evaluation and  Research (CBER), December 2014.  2 US FDA Website: http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/ , FDA Mission, accessed January 18, 2017.  3 Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format â Standa rdized Study D ata, Draft Guidance.

Introduction   With the evolution in science and technology many thought that a global pandemic outbreak wou ld be  limited to history or movies. But humanity is confronted by a conspicuous pandemic in 2020. WHO saw  it coming in 2019, but did not know when and how severe i t would be . As a precaution, WHO ha d  collaborated  with all th e key minds of the global health  care domain  to ensure active and reasonable  access to health care needs all over the world . [1]  EMA on the other side, conside ring the lessons learned during the 2009 (H1N1) flu pandemic had been  working on improving its pandemic preparedness plan. [ 2]   Some initial work on coronavirus vaccines had been completed before the COVID -19 pandemic, and  challenges to the development of effective and safe vaccines against coronaviruses have been studied.  [3]  Currently, World Health Organization (WHO) -led global solidarity trial, uses new drug, such as  remdesivir, and ârepurposedâ drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, for  effectiveness aga inst COVID -19. [ 4]   3 www.clinchoice.com  2. Role of pharmacovigilance  during a pandemic   Pharmacovigilance is no longer a mere regulatory compliant body with timely reporting of what has  happened. It is now a proactive body with the inclusion of risk management and risk minimalization  strategies g iving it a more scientific s ense. But with numerous guidelines in drug safety, overlap in the  analysis, increased workload, and non -harmonized regulations we are at times striving to meet the  regulatory compliance, which overshadows the scientific dimensio n.  A true opportunity to bri ng pharmacovigilance closer to healthcare systems arises during challenging  times. Clinicians, faced with treatment challenges  in the absence of data from randomized controlled  trials, will use available real -life observational data on both treatment benef its and harms. Integration  of pharmacovigilance with clinical practice is a key area of interest to many leaders around the world.  Attention will also be required to detect false information, and corrections to prevent harm.  There is a  lack of experience w orldwide in managing responses from a public health perspective with apparent  differences in approaches between countries to containment/mitigation strategies and regulatory  recommendations for treatment options . [5]   For instanc e, during the early stages, pandemic âinfodemicâ created a situation, where dr ugs approved  for other indications (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs,  angiotensin -converting enzy me inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antag onists, favipiravir, and  umifenovir) were being used by communities inappropriately or stopped using some drug considering  them to promote infection. [ 6]  3. What role did we play in the past?   Pre-pandemic activities by EMA to face 2009 (H1N1) outlines certain  pharmacovigilance activities  described in the core risk management plan. Those activities included strengthening the spontaneous  reporting systems, for i nstance alternative channels for reporting (web -based) and close monitoring of  events of special inter est; simplified but more frequent PSURs, providing a monthly review of safety  data received by the MAH; post -authorization safety and effectiveness studie s, including a compulsory  safety study in 9,000 subjects for each vaccine along with establishing team s dedicated to the pandemic  areas in some member states.   Between DEC -2009 and AUG -2010, pandemic pharmacovigilance update was published on its website  (weekly and then bi -weekly) providing estimates of exposure, summary of PV data available in  Eudravigilan ce and conclusions of signal reviews which were very effective tools for the agency to deal  with concerns.[ 7]  On the other side, UMC developed PaniFlow  - a tool specifically designed to capture AEFI of A/H1N1  2009 pandemic influenza vaccines and of the adverse events associa ted with treatment with oseltamivir  (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza ). WHO offered this tool free to countries, particularly emergin g and  developing countries that did not have a good AEFI reporting system in place . PaniFlow enabled  countries to quickly de tect potential safety problems in their own populations and take remedial action  if causality was established. The global picture c ould be rapidly reviewed and the international  community alerted when problems were  suspected or confirmed.  [8] The features of PaniFlow are being  incorporated into VigiFlow and VigiBase during Covid -19 pandemic.   4. What lessons were carried to the present?   Rolling review  â This is one of th e regulatory tools that EMA  uses to speed up the assessment of a  promising medicine or vaccine during a public health emergency. EMAâs human medicines committee - CHMP  reviews data as they become available from ongoing studies, before a formal application is   4 www.clinchoice.com  submitted. So that the CHMP  can reach its opinion sooner on whether or not the medicine or vaccine  should be authorized. [7]  EMAâs human medicines committee has started the first ârolling reviewâ of a COVID -19 vaccine, which  is  being developed by the company AstraZeneca in collaboration with the University of Oxford  as on 01 - OCT-2020.[ 9] and  BNT162b2, which is  being developed by BioNTech in collaboration with Pfizer  as on  06-OCT-2020.[ 10]  5. What is the need fo r evolution?   With all the preparedness, EMA listed  out challenges that required attention, like; better coordination  on  communication among the main EU stakeholders; the practice of common approaches, such as  vaccination strategies and systems for data co llection (number of vaccinated people, vaccine  effectiveness, pregnancy registries and background incidence rates of diseases). Research activities  were needed ahead of a novel pandemic into areas such as technologies and serology assays, and  methodologies  for efficient detection of safety signals during a pandemic.[ 2]  Big Data  analytics  empowers  pharmacovigilance  with  analytical  and prescr iptive  insights  in addition  to  traditional  monitoring  and reports.  An effective  pharmacovigilance  analysis  requires  capturing  and  harnessing  data  from  a wide  range  of sources  and systems  (research  studies,  EHR data,  health  economic   analysis,  drug  usage  information,  market  research,  clinical  data,  social  media  and search  data ) to be  transformed  into actionable  insights .    Though the Sentinel system achieved it to a significant extent, one of the major limitations  is its limited  effectiveness in detecting unc ommon diseases or diseases that occur outside its catchment areas of the  sentinel sites. To resolv e this and other challenges, USFDA has Sentinel System â Five-Year Strategy  2019 -2023  that outlines the challenges and action plan which aims at enhancing and  expanding the  Sentinel Systemâs foundation, including data, infrastructure, operations, and techn ology. All this to  augment its safety analysis capabilities using advances in data science and signal detection and to  accelerate access to and broaden the us e of real -world data for real -world evidence. [ 11]  6. Where is the challenge?   Collecting medicinal da ta globally  to study  drug safety across the borders needs technology along with  awareness . Timely r eview of incoming data and real -time signal detection can provide important safety  information for healthcare providers.   7. Technology   Pharmaceutical companies need to follow a wide range of processes to ensure their pharmacovigilance  is up to standards. When  a system is built on unguided evaluation of big data, active signal detection is  exposed to the inherent risks of false positive and false negative findings. [ 11]  The vast diversity  in safety  repo rting  across  the globe  is apparent  with  some  countries  using  E2B  gateway , portal  entry  and email,  while  some  are using traditional  methods  of courier  or hand  delivery   for paper  reporting  or electronic  reporting  by the compact  disc.  This pandemic  highlight  how  electronic   or paperless  reporting  is the most  effective  reporting  method.    8. Collaboration   Sharing and collaboration both within and beyond our pharmacovigilance community esp ecially   supporting pharmacovigilance colleagues in lower -income countries, will  be integral. Bringing many  different stakeholders onboard building and coordination among members of the WHO program for  international drug monitoring is vital. [4]   5 www.clinchoice.com  Collaboration with other scientific organizations emphasizes the importance of  spontaneous as a source  of real-world data. Combining da ta from spontaneous databases with real -time observational studies  using technology and networking with other sources like EHR, insurance cl aims can allow more efficient  evidence generation to explore any medicines safety issues that arise. [8]  Collaboration is important because when NIPs and NRAs fail to work with each other when developing  national AEFI or ADR surveillance systems, it leads t o duplication of effort a nd a failure to capture all  relevant data in one central repository. In addition, potential crises may go undetected through such  confusion and this becomes an additional barrier for reporting AEFIs and ADRs [ 12].   Effective collab oration was noted in Canada with PHAC and public health authorities during the 2009  influenza pandemic  in identify ing a higher than normal rate o f anaphylaxis linked to one lot (Lot 7A) of  a newly released adjuvanted H1N1 flu vaccine.  [13]  9. Prioritizatio n  Every time there is a mass administration of a drug or vaccine, you need to monitor in real -time, which  helps to report any problems as quickly as possible. Prioritizing  ICSR processing as per the need of the  hour with clinical trial (serious and non -serious) cases for products developed/tested for pandemic takes  the highest priority.  Prioritize products with significant risk minimization programs like Pregnancy  prevention programs vs. provision of educational materials. Deprioritize RMPs for established products  without additional pharmacovigilance or risk minimization measures.  Delay determination of any  corrective actions until the pandemic is declared over by WHO or capacity is back to normal and stable.  During  pandemics  having  a dedicated  safety  intel ligence  team  enables  an established  communication   channel  with  authorities , to have  proactive  communication  with  regulatory  agencies  to arrange   alternative  measures  and actions  instantly .  10. Harmonization   Do all countries have systems for monitoring vaccine s afety in place? International sharing of data from  post -marketing surveillance will be vital in guiding risk -benefit assessments and determining whether  changes in vaccination policies are needed. To improve collaboration, it is suggested that creating an  electronic platform to quickly share trusted information with healthcare professionals. Also,   consortiums could be useful to allow more rapid and comprehensive sharing of information, particularly  with industry.  [14]  11. Education, training, and communication   During  pandemics  having  a dedicated  safety  intelligence  team  enables  an established  communication   channel  with  authorities  in order  to arrange  alternative  measures  and actio ns instantly .  Effective communication , which needs to be timely, accurate, truthful  should be free and available to  everyone.  Unless the system is well understood and used by health workers at lower levels, there will  be a gross underestimation of reports.  Hence governments and partners should allocate enough  resources to establish a ded icated system and train health workers on the importance of reporting.   Training of local staff on signal detection, including procedures for passive and active surveillance and  communicat ing the importance and use of reporting tools is essential as there i s not enough training  done at the clinic level.   There has been a desire for clear, up -to-date, and utilized pharmacovigilance regulations on  international forums as well. Sp ecifically, crisis communication plans, active surveillance and causality  assessmen t should be prioritiz ed in terms of the global vaccine safety initiativeâs technical support,  training, resources and sharing of information. [15]   6 www.clinchoice.com  To boost pandemic -related signal detection activities focus should be on certain key locations wh ere  large am ounts of data can be gathered, analysed , and extrapolated for a broader investigation. An  Increase in the availability of training  (like e -learning modules) could  help to improve the quality of both  inputs and analysis , according to experts.   Patient safety  can improve only when a culture of pharmacovigilance is encouraged . The European  Unionâs innovative medicines initiative WEB -RADR project has brought two digital tools for  pharmacovigilance: mobile applications (apps) for reporting the adverse  effects of drugs and social  media data for its contribution to safety signalling . The Med Safety App is designed for healthcare  professionals a nd also the  patients to report suspected ADRs directly to the national centre . The app is  built on  ICH E2B(R2) m essaging standard  and the ICSRs can be transferred directly to a national  database.  [16]  The competence in a country for data analytics and inte rpretation  is important because  when there is  data but no idea what to do with it , then the data is of no use . Hence the p romot ion of  understanding,  education and clinical training in pharmacovigilance and effective communication of its surveillance role  to the public  is important . To impr ove patient safety worldwide, pharmacovigilance cannot exist in a  vacuum.

Hybrid Model 4   Key Outcomes of ClinChoice   FSP Models3 3 4 5 5 6 6 73Biopharmaceutical companies have a constant need for speciï¬c functional services, such as clinical  data services, that o/f_ten pose signiï¬cant challenges due to dramatically ï¬uctuating workloads, costs,  and risks. An FSP model enables drug makers to eï¬ciently respond to market needs and rapidly change  course while maintaining a consistent pool of highly qualiï¬ed professionals that can easily scale to meet  a clientâs exact needs at any time, for as long as necessary. An FSP model can be extraordinarily ï¬exible, removing the burden of employment and many day-to-day  management requirements while enhancing overall strategic control and direct integration within your  business functions. Companies have the ï¬exibility to choose the service they intend to outsource, and  this choice can be based on ï¬nancial components, lack of internal technical expertise, and other needs  within the organization. Additionally, companies can quickly pivot within an FSP model as needs change,  which o/f_ten happens during pipeline development. With an FSP model, companies need not have their existing technical teams concentrate on only one  activity, which would take away their involvement from other core business activities. Rather, the FSP  can address this work through their technical team, while the biopharmaceutical companies still retain  control of the data and output. In this whitepaper, we examine the characteristics of various FSP models and how they help bring   new therapies to market faster and cost-eï¬ectively. The primary purpose of an FSP model is to utilize outsourcing as a means to manage resources and  capacity in what can be a highly ï¬uid environment. The costs of maintaining staï¬ can be signiï¬cant,   and an FSP allows for more eï¬ective and cost-eï¬cient management of resources. In addition to  eï¬ective resource management, an FSP can be tailored, allowing a sponsor to retain any amount of  control they desire through the use of their own processes and systems, ensuring consistency across  resources, and mitigating risks typically associated with disruption.What is a Functional Service  Provider (FSP) Model? Functional Service   Provider Characteristics 4While FSP approaches have common characteristics, they can be tailored to meet individual client  requirements. Whether a short- or long-term contract, staï¬ augmentation model, managed staï¬ng  model, full outsourcing model, or any combination of these strategies, ClinChoice tailors FSP models to  suit your unique requirements and ï¬ll operational gaps in areas such as biometrics, pharmacovigilance,  regulatory operations, project management, and site monitoring functional services. Our FSP models  drive additional beneï¬ts over time by fostering long-term relationships through shared process building,  expertise, and trust. Flexible, long-term FSP models oï¬er the frameworks for innovation and continuous  process improvement to reduce research costs and timelines for important therapies. When considering whether to deploy a speciï¬c FSP model or a hybrid of multiple, there are several  questions to consider when identifying the best model: â¢  What are the business needs and the scope?  â¢  What is the anticipated volume and length of needed resource? â¢  What level of control of deliverables do you wish to maintain? â¢  What level of expertise is already available in-house?Choosing the Right FSP ModelThis highly collaborative partnership oï¬ers robust ï¬exibility, where the FSP can deliver completely  customized solutions to each client. It is a scalable model according to changing resource requirements.  Clients may resource departments or individuals in real-time without needing lengthy hiring   processes with the added risk of jeopardizing project timelines. Characteristics of a successful   FSP model may include: â¢   Provides a single functional service to a sponsor, o/f_ten across multiple programs, to maximize resource  utilization and eï¬ciencies â¢  Enables long-term relationships that develop greater eï¬ciencies over time â¢  CRO works according to sponsor SOPs and systems if requested â¢  Flexibility to make the impossible possible â¢   Risk mitigation of employee turnover and business continuity are managed by FSP, including managing  the additional hiring and training cost â¢   FSP can help companies to expand their footprint in new countries/regions by oï¬ering to carry out the  services in low-cost centers without compromising quality â¢   Possibility for the companies to convert their ï¬xed cost into variable cost, amounting to good  operational savings5â¢  What is the capacity of in-house resources to manage contracted resources? â¢  What is the overall corporate vision for the resourcing of the particular function? Staff Augmentation Model With the staï¬ augmentation model, ClinChoice provides immediate resources to clients globally.   Our experts become an extension of your team, working to your processes and environment. â¢  Immediate staï¬ng support provided by individuals with the necessary skills or experiences. â¢   Staï¬ng support can be located either remote or on site at client location, dependent on client   and complexity of required support. â¢  Dedicated FTEs working as part of the clientâs team. â¢  Utilization of sponsor processes and systems. â¢  Sponsor retains control of all deliverables and work assignments. â¢   Provides the opportunity to leverage speciï¬c CRO expertise in response to changing dynamics   via consultancy design. â¢  Cost-eï¬ective for high-level scope change requirements. For example, many biopharma companies choose to develop in-house biometrics capabilities but   still require cost-eï¬ective support and experienced personnel to integrate immediately into their team.  Through the use of a staï¬ augmentation model, ClinChoice fully aligns with a clientâs procedures and may  even provide staï¬ for on-site work. Our experts ï¬ll in any gaps as a seamless extension of your own team. Managed Staï¬ng Model The managed staï¬ng model provides skilled staï¬ and experienced management who oï¬er functional  oversight that enhances study development while working within the sponsorâs system and processes.  Managed staï¬ng models are most o/f_ten deployed into functional areas to better support larger  volumes, such as clinical monitoring, data management, programming, etc.  â¢  CRO provides experienced line managers provide functional, unit-based oversight. â¢  Client retains overall oversight, leadership, and control of all deliverables. â¢  Renewable resourcing capabilities. For example, when a client needs biometrics professionals to handle their clinical trial programs,  ClinChoiceâs managed staï¬ng model provides them with the experts they need for a contracted length  of time. Headcounts are calculated based on the work scope and approved by clients. Beyond that, the  day-to-day functions of these specialists can either be in the clientâs hands or managed by ClinChoice,  depending on the need. Salary payments, beneï¬ts, employment status, and performance management  are all conveniently and cost-eï¬ectively handled by ClinChoice, freeing up additional client resources.6System requirements, SOP requirements, and training requirements can all be tailored to the clientâs  needs with the same result of timely, quality deliverables. Full Outsourcing Model In clinical development, the Outsourcing Model gives biopharmaceutical companies the ï¬exibility to  contract out full or partial aspects of a speciï¬c function or functions to ClinChoice. The Full Outsourcing  Model is a single-source solution for managing functional needs through a dedicated partnership. â¢  Versatile resource allocation. â¢  Expertise in project delivery. â¢  Optimal, cost-eï¬ective workï¬ows. â¢  Can utilize CRO systems, technology, and processes for clients who require them. â¢  Sponsor systems and/or processes may be used. â¢  Allows for realization of geographic eï¬ciency of scale for smaller clients. â¢  CRO ensures team members are fully trained and proï¬cient. â¢  CRO assumes more risk. A Full Outsourcing Model can range from one or two employees to teams of 50 or 100+. These  partnerships can be contracted on an FTE level, a deliverable (unitized) level, or a combination of both.   In these partnerships, the CRO takes responsibility for delivering individual projects on time and budget. Hybrid FSP Model ClinChoiceâs Hybrid Model allows for any combination of models to meet the clientâs needs.

Introduction  VI.A.1.  Scope   This Module of GVP addresses the legal requirements detailed in Title IX of Directive 2001/83/EC [DIR ]  and chapter 3 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 [REG] , which are applicable to  competent authorities in   Member States, marketing authorisation holder s and the Agency  as regards the collection, data  management and reporting of suspected adverse reactions  (serious and non -serious) associated with  medicinal products for human use authorised in the European Union ( EU). Recommendations regarding  the reporti ng of emerging safety issues or of suspected adverse reactions occurring in special  situations are also presented in this Module.  The requirements provided in c hapter s IV, V and IX of the  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012 [IR] shall be ap plied in this Module.   The guidance provided in this Module does not address the collection, management and reporting of  events or patterns of use, which do not result in suspected adverse reactions  (e.g. asymptomatic  overdose, abuse, off- label use, misuse or medication error) or which do not require to be reported as  individual case safety report or as emerging safety issues. This information may however need to be  collected and presented in p eriodic safety update reports for the interpretation of safety da ta or for the  benefit risk evaluation of medicinal products. In this aspect, guidance provided in Module VII  applies.   All applicable legal requirements  detailed in this Module  are referenced in the way explained in the GVP  Introductory Cover Note and are usually identifiable by the modal verb âshallâ. Guidance for the  implementation of legal requirements is provid ed using the modal verb âshouldâ.   VI.A.2. Terminology   The definitions provided in Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC  shall be applied for the purpose of this   Module ; of particular relevance are those provided in this Section . Some general principles present ed  in the ICH-E2A and ICH -E2D guidelines  (see GVP Annex IV)  should also be adhered to ; they  are  included  as well in this Section (see GVP Annex I for all definitions applicable to GVP) .   VI.A.2.1. Adverse reaction   An adverse reaction  is a response to a med icinal product which is noxious and unintended  [DIR Art 1].  This includes adverse reactions which arise  from:  â¢ the use of a medicinal product  within the terms of the marketing authorisation ;  â¢ the use outside the terms of the marketing authorisation, includin g overdose, off- label use,  misus e, abuse and medication errors;   â¢ occupational exposure.   VI.A.2.1.1. Causality   In accordance with ICH -E2A (see GVP Annex IV) , the definition of an adverse reaction implies at least  a reasonable possibility of a causal relation ship between a suspected medicinal product and an adverse  event. A n adverse  reaction, in contrast to an adverse event, is characterised by the fact that a causal  relationship between a  medicinal product  and an occurrence is suspected. For regulatory report ing  purposes, as detailed in ICH -E2D (see GVP Annex IV) , if an event is spontaneously reported, even if  the relationship is unknown or unstated, it meets the definition of an adverse reaction. Therefore all   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 6/90     spontaneous reports notified  by healthcare profes sionals1 or consumers2 are considered suspected  adverse reactions, since they convey the suspicions of the primary source s, unless the reporter s  specifically st ate that they believe the event s to be unrelated or that a causal relationship can be  excluded.   VI.A.2.1.2. Overdose,  off-label use, misuse, abuse, occupational exposure   a. Overdose   This refers to the administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given  per administration or  cumulatively , which is above the maximum  recommended dose according to the authorised product  information. Clinical judgement should always be applied.   b. Off-label use   This relates  to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally used  for a medical purpose  not in  accordance with the  authorised  product information.    c. Misuse   This refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately  used no t in  accordance with the  authorised  product information.   d. Abuse   This corresponds  to the persistent or sporadic , intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, which  is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects [DIR Art 1].   e. Occupational exposure   This refers  to the exposure to a  medicinal product (as defined in [DIR  Art 1]) , as a result of oneâs  professional or non -professional occupation.    VI.A.2.2. Medicinal product   A medicinal product is characterised by any substance or combination of substances,   â¢ presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings; or   â¢ which may be used in or administered to huma n beings either with a view to restoring, correcting  or modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic  action, or to making a medical diagnosis  [DIR Art 1].  In accordance with  Article 107 of Directive 2001/83/EC , the scope of this module is not only applicable  to medicinal products authorised in the EU but also to any such medicinal products commercialised  outside the EU by the same marketing authorisation holder ( see VI.C.2.2 .). Given that  a medicinal  product is authorised with a defined composition,  all the  adverse reactions suspected to be related to  any of the active substance s being part of a  medicinal product authorised in the EU should be managed  in acco rdance with the requirements presented in this module.  This is valid independently  of the  strengths, pharmaceutical forms, routes of administration, presentations, authorised  indications , or  trade names of the medicinal product.   The guidance provided in th is Module also applies , subject to amendments where appropriate,  to  medicinal products supplied in the context of compassionate use  (see VI.C.1.2.2 .) as defined in Article                                                   1 See VI.A.2.3.  for definition of primary source    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 7/90     83(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. As the case may be, this guidance may also apply  to named  patient use as defined under Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC .   VI.A.2.3. Primary source   The primary source  of the information on  a suspected adverse reaction (s) is the person who reports   the facts. Several primary sources, such a s healthcare professional s and/or a consumer , may provide  information  on the same case . In this situation, all the primary sources â details , including the  qualifications,  should be provided in the case report , with the âPrimary source(s)â  section repeated as  necessary in line  with ICH-E2B(R2)  (see GVP Annex IV)2.   In accordance with the ICH-E2D (see GVP Annex IV) ,  â¢ a healthcare professional is defined as a medically -qualified person such as a physician, dentist,  pharmacist, nurse, coroner  or as otherwise  specified by local regulations;   â¢ a consumer is defined as a person who is not a healthcare professional such as a patient, lawyer,  friend , relative of a patient  or carer .  Medical documentation s (e.g. laboratory or oth er test data) provided by a consumer  that support the  occurrence of the suspected adverse reaction, or which indicate that an  identifiable healthcare  professional  suspects a reasonable possibility of causal relationship between  a medicinal product and  the reported adverse event , are sufficient to consider the spontaneous report as confirmed by a  healthcare professional.   If a consumer initially reports more than one reaction and at least one receives medical confirmation,  the whole report should be documente d as a spontaneous report confirmed by a healthcare  professional and be reported accordingly.  Similarly , if a report is submitted by a medically qualified  patient , friend , relative of the patient or care r, the case should also be considered as a spontaneou s  report confirmed  by a healthcare professional.   VI.A.2.4 . Seriousness   As described in  ICH-E2A (see GVP Annex IV ), a serious adverse reaction corresponds to  any untoward  medical  occurrence that at any dose results in deat h, is life -threatening, requires in patient  hospitalisation or prolongation of  existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or  incapacity , or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.   The characteristics/consequences should  be considered at the time of the reaction  to determin e the  seriousness of a case . For example, life -threatening refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk  of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have  caused death if more severe.   Medical judgement should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered as  serious reactions. Some medical events may jeopardise the patient  or may require an intervention to  prevent one of the above characteristics/consequences. Such  important medical events s hould be  considered as serious3. The EudraVigilance Expert Working Group has co -ordinated the development of  an important medical event (IME) terms list based on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA)  (see GVP Annex IV ). This IME list aims to facilitate the classification of suspected adverse  reactions, the analysis of aggregated data and the assessment of the i ndividual case safety reports  (ICSRs) in the frame work of the day -to-day pharmacovigilance activities.  The IME list is intended for                                                   2 See VI.C.6  as regards the electronic reporting of ICSRs  in the EU.   3 Examples are provided in section II.B of ICH -E2A (see GVP Annex IV).    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 8/90     guidance purposes only  and is available  on the EudraVigilance web site4 to stakeholders who wish to  use it for their pharmacovigilance activities . It is regularly updated in line with the  latest version of  MedDRA .  VI.A.2.5. Individual case safety report (ICSR)   This refers to the format and content for the reporting of one or several suspected adverse reactions in  relation to a medicinal product that occur in a single patient at a specific point of time.  A valid ICSR  should  include at least one  identifiable reporter, one  single  identifiable patient, at least one suspect  adverse reaction and at least one  suspect medicinal product .   VI.B. Structures and p rocesses   Section B  of this Module highlights the general principles  in relation to the collection , recording and  reporting of reports of suspected adverse reactions  associated with medicinal products  for human use ,  which are applicable to competent authorities  and marketing authorisation  holders . The definitions and  recommendations provided in VI.A. should be followed.  EU requirements are presented in VI.C..   VI.B.1. Collection  of reports   Competent authorities  and marketing authorisation holders should ta ke appropriate measures in order  to collect  and collate all reports of suspected adverse reaction s associated with medicinal products for  human use originating from unsolicited or solicited sources .   For this purpose, a pharmacovigilance system should be d eveloped to allow the acquisition of sufficient  information  for the scientific evaluation of those reports.   The system should be designed so that it helps to ensure that the collected reports are authentic,  legible, accurate, consistent, verifiable and as complete as possible for their clinical assessment.   All notifications that contain pharmacovigilance data should be recorded  and archived  in compliance  with the applicable data protection requirements  (see VI.C.6.2.2.8 . for EU requirements ).   The system should also be structured  in a way that  allows for  reports of suspected adverse reactions to  be validated (see VI.B.2 .) in a timely manner and exchanged between competent author ities and  marketing authorisation holders within the legal  reporting  time frame (see VI.B.7.1 .).  In accordance with the ICH-E2D (see GVP Annex IV) , two types of safety reports are distinguished in  the post -authorisation phase ; reports originating from unsolicited sources a nd those reported as  solicited .  VI.B.1.1. Unsolicited reports   VI.B.1.1.1. Spontaneous reports   A spontaneous report is an unsolicited communication by a healthcare professional, or consumer to a  competent authority , marketing authorisation holder  or other organis ation (e.g. Regional  Pharmacovigilance Centre, Poison Control Centr e) that describes one or more suspected adverse  reactions in a patient who was given one or more medicinal products and  that does not derive from a  study or any organi sed data collection systems where adverse event s reporting is actively s ought , as  defined in VI.B.1.2 ..                                                    4 http://eudravigilance.ema.europa.eu/human/textforIME.asp .   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 9/90     Stimulated reporting  that occur s consequent to  a direct healthc are professional  communication  (see  Module XV ), publication in the press, questioning of healthcare professionals by company  representatives , communication  from patientsâ organisations to their members , or class action lawsuit s  should be considered spontan eous reports .   Unsolicited consumer adverse reaction s reports should be handled as spontaneous reports irrespective  of any subsequent âmedical confirmationâ.   The reporting  modalities and applicable time frames for spontaneous reports are described in VI.B.7.  and VI.B.8 ..  VI.B.1.1.2. Literature reports   The s cientific and medical literature is a significant source of information for  the monitoring of the  safety pr ofile and of the risk -benefit balance of medicinal products , particularly in relation to the  detection of new safety signals or emerging safety issues . Marketing authorisation holders are  therefore expected to maintain awareness of possible publications th rough a systematic literature  review of widely used reference databases  (e.g. Medline, Excerpta Medica or Embase) no less  frequently than once a week. The marketing authorisation holder should ensure that the literature  review includes the use of r eference databases that contain the largest reference of articles in relation  to the medicinal product properties5. In addition, marketing authorisation holder s should have  procedures in place to monitor  scientific and medical publications in local journals  in cou ntries where  medicinal product s have a marketing authorisation , and to bring them to the attention of the company  safety department as appropriate.    Reports of suspected adverse reactions from the scientific and medical literature, including relevant  published abstracts from meetings and draft manuscripts, should be reviewed and assessed by  marketing authorisation holders  to identify and rec ord ICSRs originating  from spontaneous reports or  non-interventional post-authorisation studies.   If multiple medicina l products are mentioned in the publication, only those which are identified by the  publication's author(s) as having at least a possible causal relationship  with the suspected adverse  reaction should be considered by the concerned marketing authorisation holder (s).   Valid ICSRs sh ould be reported according to the modalities detailed in VI.B.7 . and VI.B.8 ..   One case should be created for each single  patient  identifiable based on characteristics provided in  VI.B.2 .. Relevant medical information should be provided  and the publication author (s) should be  considered as the primary source(s).   EU specific requirements , as reg ards medicinal products and scientific and medical publications , which  are not monitored by the Agency and for which valid ICSRs shall be reported by marketing  authorisation holders , are provided in VI.C.2.2.3 .  VI.B.1.1.3. Reports from other sources   If a marketing authorisation holder becomes aware of a repor t of suspected adverse reaction s  originating  from a non- medical source , for example  the lay press or other media, it should be handled  as a spontaneous report . Every attempt should be made to follow -up the case to obtain the minimum  information that constitutes a valid ICSR. T he same reporting time frames  should be applied as for  other spontaneous reports.                                                    5 See VI. Appendix 2.  for the detailed guidance  on the monitoring of medical and scientific literature.    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance prac tices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 10/90     VI.B.1.1.4. Information on suspected adverse reactions from the internet  or digital media   Marketing authorisation  holders  should regularly screen internet or digital media6 under their  management or responsi bility, for potential reports of suspected  adverse reactions. In this aspect,  digital media is considere d to be company sponsored if it is owned, paid for and/ or controlled by the  marketing authorisation holder7. The frequency of the screening should allow for potential valid ICSRs  to be reported to the competent authorities  within the appropriate reporting  timeframe based on the  date t he information was posted  on the internet site/digital medium . Marketing authorisation holders  may also consider utilising their websites to facilitate the collection of reports of suspected adverse  reactions (see VI.C.2.2.1 .).  If a marketing authorisation holder becomes aware of a report of suspected adverse reaction described  in any non-company sponsored digital medi um, the report should be assessed to determine whether it  qualifies for reporting.   Unsolicited cases of suspected adverse reactions  from the internet or digital media should be handled  as spontaneous reports. The same reporting time frames  as for spontaneous reports should be applied  (see VI.B.7 .).   In relation to cases from the internet  or digital media , the identifiability of the reporter refers to the  existence of a real person,  that is , it is possible to verify the  contact details  of the reporter  (e.g., an  email ad dress  under a valid format  has been provided) . If the country of the primary source is missing,  the country where the information was received , or where the review t ook place, should be used as the  primary source  country.   VI.B.1.2. Solicited reports   As def ined in ICH -E2D (see GVP Annex IV ), solicited reports of suspected adverse reactions are those  derived from organised data collection systems, which include clinical trials, non -interventional studies,  registries, post -approval named patient use programmes , other patient support and disease  management programmes, surveys of patients or healthcare providers, compassionate use or name  patient use, or information gathering on efficacy or patient compliance. Reports of suspected a dverse  reactions obtained from any of these data collection systems should not be considered spontaneous.  This is with the exception of :   â¢ suspected adverse reactions  in relation  to those  adverse events for which the protocol of non- interventional post- authorisation studies  provides diff erently  and does not require their systematic  collection  (see VI.C.1.2.1. ),  â¢ suspected adverse reactions originating from compassionate use or named patient use conducted  in Member States  where the  active collection of adverse events  occurring in th ese programmes  is  not required ( see VI.C.1.2.2 .).   For the purpose of safety reporting, solicited reports should be classified as study reports, and shou ld  have an appropriate causality assessment , to consider whether they refer to suspected adverse  reactions and therefore meet the criteria for reporting .                                                   6 Although not exhaustive, the following list should be considered as digital media: web site, web page, blog, vlog, social  network, intern et forum, chat room, health portal.   7 A donation (financial or otherwise)  to an organisation/site by a marketing authorisation holder does not constitute  ownership, provided that the marketing authorisation holder does not control the final content of the site.     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 11/90     General reporting rules for  suspected adverse reactions occurring in organised data collection s ystem s  conducted in the EU under the scope of Directiv e 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or  Directive 2001/20/EC, are presented in VI.C.1 ..   VI.B.2. Validation  of reports   Only valid ICSRs qualify for reporting. All reports  of suspected adverse reaction s should therefore be  validated before reporting them to the competent authorities  to make sure  that the minimum criteria   for reporting are  included in the report s (see ICH-E2D (see GVP Annex IV )). These are :  â¢ one or more identifiable reporter (primary source), characterised by qualification (e.g. physician,  pharmacist, other health care professional, lawyer, consumer or other non -healthcare professional)  name , initials  or address8. Whenever possible,  contact details f or the reporter should be recorded   so that follow -up activities can be performed.  However , if the reporter does not wish to provide  contact details, the ICSR should still be considered as valid providing the organisation who was  informed of the case wa s able to confirm  it directly with the reporter.  All parties providing case  information or approached for case information should be identifiable, not only the initial reporter.   â¢ one single  identifiable patient characterised by initials, patient identification number, date of birth,  age, age group or gender. The information should be as complete as possible9.   â¢ one or more  suspecte d substance/medicinal product (see VI.A.2.2.).   â¢ one or more  suspected adverse reactio n (see VI.A.2.1 .). If the primary source has made an explicit  statement that a causal relationship between the medicinal product and the adverse event has  been ex cluded and the receiver (competent authority  or marketi ng authorisation holder) agrees  with this, the report does not qualify as a valid ICSR since the minimum information is  incomplete10. The report does not also qualify as a valid ICSR if it is reported that the patient  experienced an unspecified adverse reac tion and there is no information provided on the type of  adverse reaction  experienced. Similarly, the report is  not valid if only a n outcome ( or consequence )  is notified  and (i) no further  information about the c linical circumstances is provided to conside r it  as a suspected adverse reaction , or (ii)  the primary source has not indicated a possible causal  relationship with the suspected medicinal product . For instance a marketing authorisation holder  is  made aware that a  patient was hospitalised or died , without any further information . In this  particular situation, m edical  judgement should always be applied in deciding whet her the notified  information is an  adverse reaction  or an event . For example,  a report of sudden death would  usually need to be considered as a case of suspected  adverse reaction  and reported.   The lack of any of these four elements means that the case is considered incomplete and does not qualify for reporting.  Competent authorities  and marketing authorisation holders  are expected to  exerci se due diligence in following up the case  to collect the missing data elements.  Reports,  for which  the minimum information is incomplete , should  nevertheless be recorded within the pharmacovigilance  system for use in on -going safety evaluation activities.  Recommendations on the electronic reporting of  valid ICSRs , when missing information has been obtained, are provided in VI.C.6.2.3.8.   When collecting reports of suspected adverse reactions via the internet or  digital media, the term  âidentifiableâ refers to the possibility of verification of the existence of a reporter and a patient  (see  VI.B.1.1.4 .).                                                    8 Local data privacy laws regarding patientâs and reporterâs identifiability might apply .  9 See Footnote 9.   10 There is no suspected adverse reaction .   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 12/90     When one party ( competent authority  or a marketing authorisation holder) is made aware that the  primary source may also have reported the suspected adverse reaction to another concerned party ,  the report should still be considered as a valid ICSR. All the relevant information necessary for the  detection of the duplic ate case  should be included in the ICSR11.  A valid case of suspected adverse reaction initially submitted by a  consumer cannot be downgraded to  a report  of non -related adverse event  if the contacted healthcare professional (nominated by the  consumer for follow -up information) disagrees with the consumer âs suspicion  (see VI.A.2.1.1 .). In this  situation, the opinion s of both the consumer and  the healthcare professional should be included  in the   ICSR. Guidance on the reporting  of the medical confirmation of a case, provided in ICH -E2B(R2)    Section A.1.14 ( âWas the case medically confirmed, if not initially from a healthcare professional?â)   (see GVP Annex IV ), should be followed.   For solicited report s of suspected adverse reaction s (see VI.B.1.2 .), where  the receiver  disagrees with  the reasonable possibility of causal relationship between the suspected medicinal product and the  adverse reaction expressed by the primary source, the ca se should not be downgraded to a report of  non-related adverse event . The opinion s of both, the primary source and the receiver , should be  recorded in the ICSR .   The same principle applies to the ICSR seriousness criterion, which should not be downgraded f rom  serious to non -serious if the receiver  disagrees with the seriousness reported by the primary source.   VI.B.3. Follow -up of reports   When first received, t he information i n suspected adverse reaction s reports  may be incomplete. These  reports  should be fo llowed -up as necessary to obtain supplementary detailed information significant  for  the scientific evaluation of the cases . This is particularly relevant for monitored e vents of special  interest , prospective reports of pregnancy , cases notifying  the death of a patient , cases reporting  new  risks or changes in the known risks . This is in addition to any effort  to collect missing minimum  information ( see VI.B.2 .). Any attempt to obtain follow -up information should be  documented.    Follow -up methods should be tailored towards optimi sing the collection of missing information. This  should be done in ways that  encourage the primary source to submit new information relevant for the  scientific evaluation  of a particular safe ty concern. The use of targeted specific forms in the local  language should avoid requesting the primary source to repeat  information already provided in the  initial report and/or to complete extensive questionnaires, which could discourage future spontane ous  reporting.  Therefore, c onsideration should be given to pre -populating some data fields  in those follow - up report forms  to make their completion by the primary source easy .   When information is received directly from a consumer  suggesting that an advers e reaction may have  occurred , if the information is incomplete,  attempt s should be made to obtain consent to contact a  nominated healthcare professional to obtain  further follow -up information.  When such a case, initially  reported by a consumer,  has been c onfirmed (totally or partially) by a  healthcare professional,  this  information should be clearly highlighted in the ICSR12.   For suspected adverse reaction s relating to biological medicinal products, the definite identification of  the concerned product with  regard to its manufacturing is of particular importance. Therefore,  all  appropriate measures should be taken to clearly identify the name of the product and the batch                                                   11 For further guidance on reporting of other duplicate ICSRs, refer to section A.1.11 âOther case i dentifiers in previous  transmissionâ of ICH-E2B(R2)  (see GVP Annex IV ).  12 For further guidance on reporting  this information, refer to ICH-E2B(R2) , section A.1.14 (âWas the case medically  confirmed, if not initially from a healthcare professional?â) (see GVP Annex IV) .   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 13/90     number . A business process map in relation to the mandatory follow -up of information for  the  identification of suspected biological medicinal products is presented in VI.Appendix 1. .   For cases related to vaccines,  GVP P.I.  should also be followed as appropriate.    VI.B.4. Data management   Electronic data and paper reports of suspected adverse reactions  should be stored and treated in the  same way as other medical records with appropriate respect for confidentiality  regarding patient sâ and  reporter sâ identifia bility and in accordance with local  data privacy laws.  Confidentiality of p atients'  records including personal identifiers, if provided, should always be maintained. Identifiable personal  details of reporting healthcare professiona ls should be kept in confidence . With regards to patientâs a nd  reporterâs identifiability,  case report information should be transmitted between stakeholders  (marketing authorisation holders or competent authorities) in accordance with local data privacy laws  (see VI.C.6.2 .2.8. for the processing of personal data in ICSRs in the EU).   In order to ensure pharmacovigilance data security and confidentiality , strict access controls  should be  applied to documents and to databases to authorised personnel only . This security exten ds to the  complete data path. In this aspect, p rocedures should be implemented to ensure security and non - corruption of data during data transfer.   When transfer of pharmacovigilance data occurs within an organisation or between  organisations   having conclud ed contractual agreements , the mechanism should be such that there is confidence that  all notifications are received ; in that , a confirmation and/or reconciliation process should be   undertaken.   Correct d ata entry, including the appropriate use of terminol ogies, should be verified  by quality  assurance auditing , either systematically or by regular random evaluation. Data entry staff should be  instructed in the use of the terminologies, and their proficiency confirmed .   Data received from the primary source s hould be treated in an u nbiased and unfiltered way and  inferences as well as imputation s should be avoided during data entry or electronic transmission . The  reports  should include the verbatim text as used by the primary source or  an accurate translation o f it.  The original verbatim text  should be coded usi ng the appropriate terminology as described in VI.B.8 . In  order to e nsure cons istency in the coding practices,  it is recommended to use , where applicable, the  translation of the terminology in the local language  to code the verbatim text .   Electronic data s torage should allow traceability (audit trail) of all data entered or modified, including  dates and sources of received data, as well as dates and destinations of transmitted data.   A procedure sh ould be in place to account for identification and management of duplicate cases at data  entry and during the generation of aggregated reports (see VI.C.6.2.4 .).  VI.B.5. Quality management   Competent authorities  and marketing authori sation holders should have a quality management system  in place to ensure compliance with the necessary quality standards at every stage of case  documentation,  such as data collection, data transfer, data m anagement , data coding , case validation,  case evaluation , case follow -up, ICSR reporting  and case archiving  (see VI.C.6.2.4 . and Module I ).  Conformity of stored data with initial and follow -up reports should be verified  by quality control  procedures, which permit  for the validation against the original data or images thereof. In this aspect,  the source data (e.g., letters, emails, records of telephone calls that include details of an event) or an  image of the source data should be easily accessible.    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 14/90     Clear written standard operating procedures should guarantee  that the roles an d responsibilities and  the required tasks are clear to all parties involved and that there is provision for proper control and,  when needed, change of the system. This is equally applicable to activities that are contracted out to  third parties , whose  procedures should be reviewed to verify that they are adequate and compliant  with applicable requirements.   Staff directly performing pharmacovigilance activities , should be appropriately trained in applicable  pharmacovigilance legislation and guidelines in ad dition to specific training in report processing   activities for which they are responsible and/or undertake . Other personnel who may receive or  process safety reports (e.g. clinical development, sales, medical information, legal, quality control)  should be  trained in adverse event collection and reporting in accordance with internal policies and  procedures.   VI.B.6. Special situations   VI.B.6.1. Use of a medicinal product du ring pregnancy or breastfeeding    a. Pregnancy   Reports , where the embryo or foetus may have been exposed to medicinal products (either through  maternal exposure or transmission of a medicinal product via semen following paternal exposure) ,  should be followed -up in order to collect information on the outcome of the pregnancy and  development o f the child  after birth . The recommendations provided in the Guideline on the Exposure  to Medicinal P roducts during Pregnancy: N eed for P ost-Authorisation Data (see GVP Annex III ) should  be considered as regard the monitoring, collection and reporting of information in these specific  situations in order to facilitate the scientific evaluation.  When an active substance (or one of its  metabolites)  has a long half -life, this should be taken into account when assessing  the possibility of  exposure of the embryo , if the medicinal product was taken before conception.    Not infrequently, pregnant women or healthcare professionals will contact either competent authorities   or marketing authorisation holders  to request  information on the teratogen icity of a medicinal pr oduct  and/or experience of use during pregnancy.  Reasonable attempt s should be made to obtain  information on a ny possible medicinal product exposure to a n embryo or  foetus  and to follow -up on the  outcome  of the pregnancy .   Reports  of exposure to medicinal products during pregnancy should contain  as many detailed elements  as possible in order  to assess the causal relationship s between any reported adverse events and the  exposure to the suspected medicinal product.  In this context the use  of standard structur ed  questionnaires is recommended.   Individual cases with an abnormal outcome associated with a medicinal product  following exposure  during pregnancy  are classified  as serious reports and should be reported, in accordance with the   requirements outlined in VI.B.7.13.  This especially refers to:   â¢ reports of congenital anomalies  or development al delay,  in the foetus  or the child;   â¢ reports of foetal death and spontaneous abortion; and   â¢ reports of suspected adverse reactions in the neonate that are classified as serious.                                                    13 See VI.C.6.2.3.1  for electronic reporting recommendations in the EU.    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 15/90     Other cases, such as reports of induced termination of pregnancy without information on congenital  malformation, reports of pregnancy exposure without outcome data  or reports which have a normal  outcome , should not be reported since there is no suspected adverse reaction . These reports should  however be collected and discussed  in the periodic safety update reports ( see Module VII ).   However, i n certain circumstances, reports of pregnancy exposure with no suspected reactions may  necessitate to be reported. This may be a condition o f the marketing authorisation or stipu lated in the  risk management plan; for example pregnancy exposure to medicinal products contraindicated in  pregnancy or medicinal products with a special need for surveillance because of a high teratogenic potential (e.g. thalidomide, isotretinoin).   A signal of a possible teratogen effect (e.g. through a cluster of similar abnormal outcomes) should be  notified immediately  to the competent authorities  in accordance with the recommendations presented  in VI.C.2.2.6 .  b. Breastfeeding   Suspected a dverse reactions which occur  in infants following exposure to a medicinal product from  breast milk  should be reported in accordance with the criteria outlined in VI.B.7 .14.  VI.B.6.2. Use of a medicinal product in  a paediatric  or elderly  population   The collection of safety information in the paediatric  or elderly  population is importan t. Reasonable   attempts  should therefore be made to obtain  and submit  the age or age group of the patien t when a  case is reported by a healthcare professional, or consumer  in order to be able to identify  potential  safety signals specific to a particular population .  As regards the paediatric population, t he guidance published by the Agency15 on the conduct of   pharmacovig ilance in this population  should be followed.   VI.B.6.3. Reports of overdose , abuse, off -label use, misuse , medication  error or occupational exposure   For the purpose of this Module, medication error refers to any unintentional error in the presc ribing,  dispensing, or administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the healthcare professional  or consumer.   Reports of overdose , abuse , off-label use, misuse , medication error  or occupational exposure  with no  associated adverse reaction  should not be reported as ICSRs . They  should be considered in p eriodic  safety update report s as applicable . When those reports constitute safety issues impacting  on the risk - benefit balance of the medicinal product , they  should be notified to the competent authorities  in  accordance with the recommendations provided in VI.C.2.2 .6.  Reports  associated with suspected adverse reactions should be  subject to reporting  in accordance with  the criteria outlined in VI.B.7 . and with the electronic reporting requirements described in VI.C.6.2.3.3 .  They should be routinely followed -up to ensure that the information is as complete a s possible with  regards to the symptoms, treatments , outcomes , context of occurrence (e.g., error in prescription,  administration, dispensing , dosage , unauthorised indication or population, etc. ).                                                    14 See Footnote 16 .  15 Guideline on conduct of pharmacovigilance for medicines used by the paediatric population .   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (G VP) â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 16/90     VI.B.6.4. Lack of therapeutic efficacy   Reports of lack of  therapeutic efficacy  should be recorded and followed- up if incomplete. They  should  not normally be reported , but should be discussed in p eriodic safety update report s as applicable .  However, in certain circumstances,  reports of lack of  therapeutic efficacy may require to be reported  within a 15 -day time frame  (see VI.C.6.2.3.4 . as regards electronic reporting in the EU) . Medicinal  products used  in critical conditions or  for the treatment of life -threatening disea ses, vaccines,   contraceptives are examples of such cases.  This applies  unless the reporter has specifically stated that  the outcome  was due to disease progression and was not related to the medicinal product.   Clinical judgement should be used when conside ring if other cases of lack of therapeutic efficacy  qualify for reporting. For example, an antibiotic  used in a life-threatening situation  where the medicinal  product was not in fact appropriate for the in fective agent should not be reported. However, a li fe- threatening infection , where the lack of therapeutic efficacy appear s to be due to the development of a  newly resistant strain of a bacterium pr eviously regarded as susceptible,  should be reported within 15  days.   For vaccines, cases of lack of therapeu tic efficacy should be reported, in particular with the view to  highlight potential signals of reduced immunogenicity in  a sub -group of vaccinees, waning immunity,  or strain replacement. With regard to the latter, it is considered that spontaneously reported cases of  lack of therapeutic efficacy by a healthcare professional may constitute a signal of strain replacement.  Such a signal may need prompt action and further investigation through post- authorisation safety  studies as appropriate. General guidance regarding the monitoring of  vaccines failure , provided in the  Report of CIOMS/WHO Working Group  on Vaccine Pharmacovigilance16, may be followed.   VI.B.7. Reporting of I ndividual case safety reports (I CSRs )  Only valid ICSR s (see VI.B.2.) should  be reported. The clock for the  reporting of a valid ICSR starts as  soon as the information containing the minimum reporting criteria has been brought to the attention of   the national or regional pharmacovigilance centre of a com petent authority  or of any personnel of the  marketing authorisation holder , including medical representatives  and contractors. This date should be  considered as day zero . It is the first day when a receiver gains  knowledge of a valid ICSR, irrespective  of whether the information is received during a week end or public holiday.  Reporting timelines are  based on calendar days.   Where the marketing authorisation holder has set up contractual arrangements with a person or an  organisation, explicit procedures and detailed agreements should exist between the marketing  authorisation holder and the person/organisation to ensure that the marketing authorisation holder can  comply with the reporting obligations.  These procedures should in particular  specify the processes for  exchange of safety information, including timelines and regulatory reporting responsibilities and should  avoid duplicate reporting to the competent authorities .  For ICSRs described in the scientific  and medical  literature  (see VI.B.1.1.2 .), the clock starts (day  zero) with awareness of a publication containing the minimum information  for reporting . Where  contractual arrangements are made with a person/organisation to perform literature searches and/or   report valid ICSRs, detailed agreements should exist to ensure that the marketing authorisation holder  can comply with the reporting obligations.                                                    16 Council for Interna tional Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS).

GenÃ¨ve: CIOMS; 2012.   http://www.cioms. ch/   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 17/90     When additional significant  information is received for a previously reported case, the reporting time  clock starts again for the submission of a  follow -up report from the da te of receipt of the relevant  follow -up information. For the purpose of reporting, significant  follow -up information corresponds to  new medical or administrative information that could impact on the assessment or management of a   case or could change its se riousness criteria; non -significant  information includes updated comments  on the case assessmen t or corrections of typographical errors in the previous case version.  See also  VI.C.6.2.2.7 . as regards the distinction between s ignificant and non- significant follow -up information .  VI.B.7.1. Reporting time frames   In general , the reporting of serious valid ICSRs is required as soon a s possib le, but in no case later  than 15 calendar days after  initial receipt of the information by the national or regional  pharmacovigilance centre of a competent authority  or by any personnel of the marketing authorisation  holder , including medical representativ es and contractors. This applies to initial and follow -up  information.  Where a  case initially reported as serious becomes  non-serious,  based on new follow -up  information,  this information should still be reported within 15 days; the reporting time frame for non- serious reports should then be applied for the subsequent  follow -up reports .  Information as regards the reporting time frame of non -serious valid ICSRs in the EU is provided in  VI.C.3.  VI.B.8. Reporting modalit ies  Taking into account the international dimension of adverse reaction s reporting and the need to achieve  harmonisation  and high quality between all involved parties , ICSRs  should be submitted electronically   as structured data with the use of controlled v ocabularies for the relevant data elements where  applicable . In this aspect , with regard to the content and format of electronic ICSRs,  competent  authorities  and marketing authorisation holders should adhere to the following internationally agreed   ICH17 guidelines and standards :  â¢ ICH M1 terminology -  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  (see GVP Annex IV );  â¢ MedDRA Term Selection: Points to Consider Document -  The latest version of the ICH -endorsed  Guide for MedDRA U sers (see GVP Annex IV );  â¢ ICH M2 EWG -  Electronic Transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports Message Specification   (see GVP Annex IV );  â¢ ICH E2B(R2) -  Maintenance of the ICH Guideline on Clinical Safety Data Management: Data  Elements for Transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports  (see GVP Annex IV );  â¢ ICH E2B Implementation Working Group -  Questions & Answers (R5) (March 3, 2005) (see GVP  Annex IV ).  As technical standards e volve over time, the above referred documents may require revision and  maintenance. In this context, the lates t version of these documents should always be taken into  account.   Information  regarding EU specific reporting modalities  is provided in VI.C.4.                                                    17 http://www.ich.org/    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 18/90     VI.C. Operation of the EU n etwork   Section C  of this Module highlight s the EU specific requirements , as defined in Directive 2001/83/EC  and Regulation (EC)  No 726/2004, in relation to the collection, management and reporting of reports  of suspected adverse reaction s (serious and non -serious) associated with medicinal produc ts for  human use authorised in the EU , independently of their condition of use . They are applicable to  competent authorities in Member States and/or to marketing authorisation holders . Section C  should  be read in conjunction  with the definitions and genera l principles  detailed in VI.A and VI.B of this  Module  and with t he requirements provided in c hapter s IV, V and IX of the Commission Implementing  Regulation (EU) No 520/ 2012 [IR].  VI.C.1. Reporting  rules for clinical trials  and post -authorisation studies in  the EU   The pharmacovigilance rules laid down in Directive 2 001/83/EC and Regulation (EC)  No 726/2004 do  not apply to investigational medicinal products and non -investigational medicinal products18 used in  clinical trials conducted in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC19.   Post-authorisation  safety or efficacy  studies requested by competent authorities in Member States or  the Agency  in accordance with Directive 2001/83/E C or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, or conducted  voluntarily by marketing authorisation holders,  can either be clinical trials or non -interventional post- authorisation studies as shown in Figure VI .1. The s afety reporting falls therefore either under the  scope of Directive 2001/20/EC for any clinical trials  or under the provisions set out in Directive  2001/83/EC an d Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for any non-interventional post-authorisation  studies .  Suspected adverse reactions should  not be reported under both regimes, that is Directive 2001/20/E C  as well as Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Directive 2001/83/EC  as this create s duplicate  reports .   Further guidance on post -authorisation safety studies is provided in Module VIII .  The different types of studies and clinical trials which can be conducted in the EU are illustrated in  Figure VI.1. The safety reporting for cl inical trials corresponding to s ection s A, B, C and D of Figure  VI.1. follow s the requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. The safety reporting for non -interventional  post-authorisation studies corresponding to section E and F follow s the requirements of Directive  2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The reporting rules  of reports of suspected adverse  reactions to the EudraVigilance database modules are dependent on the types of organised collection  systems where they occurred; recommendations  provided in VI.C.6.2.1  should be followed.                                                    18 For guidance on these terms, see The Rules Governing Medicinal Product s in the European Union , Volume 10, Guidance  Applying to C linical Trials, G uidance on Investigational Medicinal Products  and Non -Investigational Medicinal Products  (NIMPs ) (Ares(2011)300458 - 18/03/2011 ).  19 See DIR Art 3(3), Art 107(1) thir d subparagraph.

VI.C.1. 1. Reporting rules for  clinical trials   A suspected adverse reaction to an investigational medicinal product occurring in a  clinical trial which  falls under the scope of  Directive 2001/20/EC is only to be addressed by the sponsor based on the  requirem ents detailed in  that Directive. It is therefore excluded from the scope of this M odule  even if  the clinical trial where the suspected adverse reaction occurred is a post-authorisation safety or  efficacy study, requested in accordance with Directive 2001/8 3/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004,  or  conducted voluntarily .   If a clinical trial,  conducted under the scope of  Directive 2001/20/EC , yields safety concerns which  impact o n the risk -benefit balance of an authorised medicinal product, the competent author ities in the  Member States where the medicinal product is authorised and the Agency should be notified  immediately in accordance with the modalities detailed in VI.C.2.2.6 . This applies as well if a safety  conce rn arises from a clinical trial conducted exclusively outside the EU.   The safety data from clinical trials to be presented in the relevant sections of the periodic safety  update report of the authorised medicinal product are detailed in Module VII .

The investigator or the sponsor is encouraged to report the case  to the competent authority in  the Member State where the reaction occurred or to the marketing authorisation holder  of the  suspected medicinal product , but not to both to avoid duplicate reporting20. Whe re made aware  of such  case, the competent authority  or the marketing authorisation holder  should apply  the reporting  requirements  described in VI.C.3 , VI.C.4  and VI.C.6 . As regards electronic reporting, the  recommendations detailed  in VI.C.6.2.3.7  should be followed.   VI.C. 1.2. Reporting rules for non- interventional post-authorisation studies,  compassionate use and named patient use   This Section applies to non -interventional post-authorisation studies , compassionate use and named  patient use . For th ese org anised data collection schemes,  a system  should be put in place  to record  and document complete and comprehensive case information  on solicited adverse events21 which need  to be collected as specified in VI.C.1.2.1. and in VI.C.1.2.2 .. These adverse events should be  systematically assessed to determine whether they  are possib ly related to the studied (or supplied)  medicinal product s (see ICH-E2D (see GVP Annex IV) ). A method of causality assessment should be  applied for assessing the causal role of the studied (or supplied)  medicinal product s in the solicited   adverse event s (for example, the WHO-UMC system for standardised case causality assessment ). An  adverse event should be classified as an adverse reaction, if there is at least a reasonable possibility of  causal relatio nship . Only valid ICSRs  (see VI.B.2 .) of adverse reactions,  which are suspected to be  related to the studied (or supplied) medicinal product  by the primary source or the receiver  of the  case, should be reported in accordance with the requirements provided in VI.C.3 ., VI.C.4 . and  VI.C.6 .2.3.7. . Other reports of adverse events should be su mmarised as part of any interim safety  analysis and  in the final study report, where applicable.   In situations where  adverse reactions are  suspected to be related to medicinal products other than the studied (or supplied) medicine,  these  reports should be  managed, classified  and reported as spontaneous  ICSRs . They should be notified  by  the primary source  to the competent authority in the Member State  where the reaction s occurred  or to  the marketing authorisation holder  of the suspected medicinal product , but not to both ( to avoid  duplicate reporting) .   Where made aware, in the frame of th ese organised data collection schemes, of events which affect  the known risk -benefit balance of the studied ( or supplied ) medicinal product and/or impact on public  health, the marketing authorisation holder should notify the concerned competent authorities and the  Agency in accordance with the modalities detailed in VI.C.2.2.6 ..  Further guidance on post -authorisation studies condu cted by marketing authorisation holders is  provided in VI.C.2.2.2 ..  The requirements provided in this Module do not apply to non- interventional post- authorisation studies  conducted by organisations  such as academia,  medical research charities or research organisations in  the public sector . These organisations should follow local requirements as regards the reporting of  cases of suspected adverse reactions to the compet ent authority in the Member State where the                                                   20 See The Rules Governing Medicinal Product s in the European Union, Volume 10, Detailed guidance on the collection,  verification and presentation of adverse event/reaction reports arising from clinical trials on medicinal products for human  use (âCT- 3â), (2011/C 172/01) .  21See GVP Annex I  for definition o f adverse event.

However, where a study conducted by one of these organisation s is directly  initiated, managed , financed , or where its design is controlled by a marketing authorisation holder   (voluntarily or pursuant to obligations imposed in accordance with Articles 21a or 22a of Directive  2001/83/EC  and Articles 10 or 10(a) of Regulation 726/2004) , the requirements provided in this   Module are applicable22. In this context, contractual agreements should be in place to clearly define  the role and responsibiliti es for implementing these requirements  (see Module I ).  VI.C. 1.2.1. Non-interventional post-authorisation studi es  Non-interventional post-authorisation studies23 should be distinguished between those with primary  data collection directly from healthcare professionals or consumers  and study designs which are based  on the secondary use of data.  Depending on the study design, the requirements provided hereafter  apply24. In case of doubt, the reporting requirement s should be clarified with the concerned competent  authorities in Member States. N ational legislation should be followed as applicable regarding  the  obligations towards local ethics committees .   a. Non-interventional post -authorisation studies with primary data collection   Information on  all adverse events  should be collected from  healthcare professionals or consumers in  the course of the study unless the protocol provides differently  with a due justification for not collecting  certain adverse events . For all collected adverse events, comprehensive and high quality information  should be sought  in a manner which allow for valid ICSRs to be reported with in the appropriat e  timeframes (see VI.C.3. ).   For all collected adverse events, cases of adverse reactions, which are suspected to be related to the studied medicinal product by the primary source or the receiver of the case, should be reported  in  accordance with the requirements provided in VI.C.3 . and VI.C.4 .. Valid ICSRs should be classified as  solicited reports ( see VI.C.2.2.2 . and VI.C.6.2.3.7. ). See summary in Table VI.1. .  All fatal outcomes should be considered as adverse events which should  be collected.  In certain  circumstances, suspected adverse reactions with  fatal outcome may not be subject to expedited  reporting as ICSR s, for example because they refer to  study  outcomes  (efficacy end points), because  the patients included in the study have a disease with high mortality, or because the fatal outcomes have no relation to the objective of the study.  For these particular situations, the rational for not  reporting certain adverse reactions with fatal outcomes should be clearly described in the protocol.    All collected  adverse events should be summarised as part o f any interim safety analysis and in the  final study report.                                                     22 This does not concern donation of a medicinal product for research purpose if the marketing authorisation holder has no  control on the study.   23 See GVP Annex I  for definition of non -interventional study.   24 For combined study designs  with primary and secondary data collection , the same requirements as for  studies with  primary data collection should be followed.    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 22/90     Table VI.1.  Non-interventional post- authorisation studie s with primary data collection : Requirements  concerning  adverse events collection and suspected adverse reactions reporting.    Adverse events for which  the protocol does not provide differently  and those with fatal outcomes   Collection requirements  â¢ Collect comprehensive and high quality information.   â¢ Perform causality assessment.   Reporting requirements  for suspected adverse  reactions â¢ Cases of adverse reactions, which are suspected to be related to  the studied medicinal product by the primary source or the  receiver of the case, should be reported in the form of valid ICSRs  in line with the appropriate timeframes (See VI.C.3)   â¢ In certain circumstances, fatal  outcome may not be subject to  expedited reporting as ICSRs. A justification should always be  provided in the protocol.   Reporting requirements  for adverse events  â¢ Summarise all collected adverse events as part of any interim  safety analysis and in the final study report.   For adverse events for which the protocol provides differently and does not require their systematic  collection, healthcare professionals and consumers should be informed in the protocol (or other study  documents) of the possibility to rep ort adverse reactions (for which they suspect a causal role of a  medicine) to the marketing authorisation holder of the suspected medicinal product (studied or not) or  to the concerned competent authorities via the national spontaneous reporting system. Va lid ICSRs  should be managed, classified and reported as spontaneous by the receiver of the reports . When made  aware of them, these reports should also be summarised in the relevant study reports.   b. Non-interventional post-authorisation studies based on secon dary use of data   The design of such studies is characterised by the secondary use of data previously co llected from  consumers  or health care professionals for other purposes. Examples include medical  chart re views  (including following -up on data with healthcare professionals), analysis of electronic health care  records, systematic reviews,  meta-analyses.   For these studies,  the reporting of suspected adverse reactions in the form of ICSRs is not required.  Reports of adverse events/reactions should be summari sed as part of any interim safety analysis and  in the final study report unless the protocol provides for different  reporting .   VI.C. 1.2.2. Compassionate use  and named patient use   The guidance provided in this Module applies, subject to amendments where appropriate,  to medicinal  products supplied in the context of compassionate use as defined in Article 83(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. As the case may be, this guidance may also apply to named patient use as defined under Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/ 83/EC.  Local requirements  should be followed as applicable.   Where an organisation 25 or a healthcare professional, supplying a medicinal product under  compassion ate use or named patient use, is notified or becomes aware of a n adverse event , it should  be mana ged as follow s depending on  the requirements  in the concerned Member State:    â¢ For compassionate  use and named patient use conducted in Member States where the active  collection of adverse events occurring in these programmes is required, reports of adverse                                                   25 E.g. sponsor, applicant, marketing authorisation holder, hospital or wholesaler.    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 23/90     reactions, which are  suspected to be related to the supplied medicinal product  by the primary  source or the receiver of the case , should be reported.  They should be considered as solicited  reports  (see VI.C.2.2.2 . and VI.C.6.2.3.7.).   â¢ For compassionate use and named patient use conducted in Member States  where the active  collection of  adverse events occurring in these programmes is not required, any notified noxious or  unintended response to the supplied medicinal product should be reported. It  should be considered  as a spontaneous report of suspected adverse reaction .   VI.C.2. Colle ction of reports   VI.C.2.1. Responsibi lities of Member State s  Each M ember State sh all have in place a system for the collection and recording of unsolicited and  solicited  reports  of suspected adverse reactions  that occur in its  territory  and which are brought to its  attention by healthcare professionals, consumers , or marketing authorisation holde rs26 [DIR Art 101(1)  and 107a(1)] . In this context, competent authorities in Member States shall establish procedures for  collecting and recording all  reports of  suspected adverse reactions that occur in their territory  [IR Art  15 (2)]. T he general  principl es detailed in VI.B, together with the reporting modalities presented in  VI.C.3, VI.C.4 and VI.C.6  should be applied to those reports . Pharmacovigilance data and documents  relating to individual authorised medicinal products shall be retained as long as the product is  authorised and for at least 10 years after the marketing authorisat ion has expired. However, the  documents shall be retained for a longer period where Union law or national law so requires  [IR Art  16(2)].   Each Member State shall take all appropriate  measures to encourage healthcare professionals and  consumers in their ter ritory to report suspected adverse reactions to their competent authority. In  addition , the competent authority in  a Member State may impose specific obligations on healthcare  professionals.  To this end, competent authorities in Member States shall facilitate in their territory the  reporting of suspected adverse reactions by mean s of alternative straightforward reporting systems,  accessible to healthcare professionals and consumers, in addition to web -based formats [DIR Art 102] .  Information on the differen t ways of reporting suspected adverse reactions related to medicinal  products , shall be made publicly available including by means of national medicines web -based portals  [DIR 106(e)]. To increase awar eness of the reporting systems, organisations representing consumers  and healthcare professionals may be involved  as appropriate [DIR Art 102] .  Standard web- based structured forms for the reporting of suspected adverse reactions by healthcare  professionals and consumers shall be developed by the Agency in coll aboration with Member States in  order to collect across the EU harmonised information relevant for the evaluation of suspected adverse  reactions, including errors associated with the use of medicinal products  [REG Art 25] . In this context,  core data fields  for reporting  will be made available by the Agency to the competent authorities in  Member States for use in their national reporting systems as applicable .   The reports of suspected adverse reactions received from healthcare professionals and consumers  should be acknowledged where appropriate and further information should be provided to the reporters  as requested and when available .   For reports submitted by a marketing authorisation holder, Member States on whose territory the  suspected adverse reaction occurred may involve the marketing authorisation holder in the follow -up  of the reports  [DIR Art 107a(2) ].                                                   26 Marketing authorisation holders shall report ICSRs to the competent authorities in Member States in accordance with the  transitional provisions set out in Article 2(4) and Article 2(5) of Directive 2010/84/EU and further detailed in VI.C.4.1 .   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 24/90     Each Member State shall ensure that the competent authority responsible for medicinal products within  that Member State is informed of any suspected adver se reaction , brought to the attention of any  other authority, body, institution or organisation responsible for patient safety within that Member  State, and that valid ICSRs are made available to the EudraVigilance database. Therefore, where  reports o f suspected adverse reactions are sent directly to other authorities, bodies, organisations  and/or institutions  within a Member State, the competent authority in that Member State shall have  data exchange agreements in place so that these reports are brought to its attention and are made  available to Eudra Vigilance in a timely manner [DIR Art  107a(5) ]. This applies as well to reports of  suspected adverse reactions arising from an error associated with the use of a medicinal product.  Those error reports of su spected adverse reactions for which  a competent authority in a Member  State  is made aware of, including those received from the EudraVigilance database in accordance with  Article 24(4) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, shall also be brought to the attention of  other  authorities, bodies, organisations and/or institutions responsible for patient safety within that Member State  [DIR Art 107a(5)].   Unless there are justifiable grounds resulting from pharmacovigilance activities, individual Member  States shall not impose any additional obligations on marketing authorisation holders for the reporting  of suspected adverse reactions  [DIR Art 107a(6) ].  VI.C.2. 2. Responsibilities of the m arketing authorisation holder  in the EU    Each m arketing authorisation holder shall h ave in place a system for the collection and recording of all  reports of suspected adverse reactions which are brought to its attention , whether reported  spontaneously by healthcare professionals or consumers or occurring in the context of a post- authorisa tion study [DIR A rt 104(1), Art  107(1)].  Marketing authorisation holders shall not refuse to  consider reports of suspected adverse reactions received electronically or by any other  appropriate means from patients and healthcare professionals [ Art 107(2)]. All those r eports shall  be accessible at a single point within the Union [Dir Art 107(1)].   Marketing authorisation holders shall establish mechanisms enabling the traceability and follow -up of  adverse reaction reports while complying with the data protection legislation [ IR Art 12 (1)].  Pharmacovigilance data and documents relating to individual authorised medicinal products shall be  retained as long as the product is authorised and for at least 10 years after the marketing  authorisation has ceased to exist. However, the documents shall  be retained for a longer period where  Union law or national law so requires  [IR Art 12 (2)].  With regard to the collection and recording of reports of suspected adverse reactions , marketing  authorisation holder s responsibilities apply to reports related to medicinal products ( see VI.A.2.2 .) for  which ownership cannot be excluded on  the basis of one the following criteria : medicinal product  name, active substance name, pharmaceu tical form,  batch number  or route of administration.  Exclusion based on the primary source count ry or country of origin of the adverse reaction  is possible if  the marketing authorisation holder  can demonstrate that the suspected medicinal product has never   been supplied or placed on the market in that territory or that the product is not a travel medicine   (e.g., anti -malarial medicinal product) .   The m arketing authorisation holder shall ensure that any information on  adverse reactions,  suspected  to be relat ed to at least one of the active substance s of its medicinal products authorised in the EU , is  brought to its attention by  any company  outside the EU  belonging to the same mother company ( or  group of companies ) 27. The same applies to the marketing authoris ation holder when having                                                   27 As outlined in the Commission Communication on the Community Marketing Authorization Procedures for Medicinal  Products ( 98/C 229/03 ).   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 25/90     concluded a commercial agreement with a company outside the E U for one of its medicinal product  authorised in the EU . The clock for reporting (s ee VI.B.7 .) starts when a valid ICSR is first received by  one of these companies  outside the EU .  In addition to the requirements presented in this Section , the general principles detailed in Section  VI.B., together with the reporting modalities presented in VI.C.3 ., VI.C.4 . and VI.C.6 . should be  applied by marketing authorisation holders to all reports of suspected adverse reactions.   VI.C.2.2.1. Spontaneous reports   Marketing authorisation holders sh all record all reports of suspected adverse reactions originating from  within or outside the EU, which are brought to their attention spontaneously by healthcare  professionals, or  consumers . This includes  reports of suspected adverse reactions received  electronically or by any other appropriate means  [DIR Art 107(1), Art 107(2)]. In this context,  marketing authorisation holders may  consider utilising their websites to facilitate th e collection of  reports of suspected adverse reaction s by providing adverse reaction s forms for reporting , or  appropriate contact details for direct communication  (see VI.B.1.1.4 .).  VI.C.2.2.2. Solicited rep orts  In accordance with Art 107(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC , marketing authorisation holders shall record all  reports of suspected adverse reactions originating from within or outside the EU, which occur in post- authorisation studies , initiated, managed, or  financed  by them28.  For non -interventional post- authorisation studies, th is requirement  applies to study designs based on primary data collection  and  the guidance provided in VI.C.1.2.1. should be followed. For all solicited reports  (see VI.B.1.2. ),  marketing authorisation holders  should have mechanisms in place to record and document complete  and comprehensive case information  and to evaluate that information , in order to allow meaningful  assessment of individual cases and reporting of valid ICSRs (see VI.B.2 .) related to the studied (or  supplied) medicinal  product . Marketing authorisation holder s should therefore exercise due diligence in  establishing such system , in following -up those reports  (see VI.B.3 .) and in seeking  the view of the  primary source as regard the causal role of the studied (or supplied) medicinal product  on the notified  adverse event . Where  this opinion is missing , the marketing authorisation holder should exercise its  own judgement  based on the information available in orde r to decide whether the report is a valid  ICSR, which should be reported to the comp etent authorities.  This requirement does not apply to study  designs based on secondary use of data  since reporting of ICSRs is not required ( see VI.C.1.2.1 .).  Safety data from solicited reports to be presented in the relevant sections of the periodic safety update  report of the authorised medicinal product are detailed in Module VII .   VI.C.2.2.3. Case reports  published in the scientific l iterature   General principles in relation to the monitoring  for individual cases of suspected adverse reactions  described in the scientific  and medical literature are provide d in VI.B.1.1.2 .. As regards the screening   of the scientific and medical literature , the requirements provided in this Module are part of  the wider  literature searches which need to be conducted for periodic safety update reports (see Module VII ).  In accordance with Article 107(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC , in order to avoid the reporting of duplicate  ICSRs, marketing authorisation holders shall only report those ICSRs described in the scientific and  medical literature which is not reviewed by the Agency , for all medicinal products containing active  substances which are not in cluded in the list monitored  by the Agency pursuant to Article 27 of                                                   28 This does not concern donation of a medicinal product for research purpose if the marketing authorisation holder has no  control on the study.    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 26/90     Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. Until such lists of scientific and medical  literature and active subst ance  names  are published by the Agency, marketing authorisation holders should monitor a ll the active  substances for which they hold a marketing authorisation in the EU by accessing  a widely used  systematic literature review and reference database, in line with the principles detailed in VI.B.1.1.2 .  and in VI. Appendix  2.   Articles can be excluded from the reporting of ICSRs by the marketing authorisation holder if another  company's branded medicinal product is the suspected medicinal product. In the absence of a specified  medicinal product source and/or invented name, ownership of the medicinal product should be  assumed for arti cles about an active substance , unless alternative reasons  for exclusion  detailed  hereafter  apply :  â¢ where ownership of the medicinal product by the marketing authorisation holder can be excluded  on the basis of the criteria detailed in VI.C.2.2 .;   â¢ for individual case safety reports  identified in the scientific and medical literatur e that originate in a  country where a company holds a marketing authorisation but has never commercialised the  medicinal product ;  â¢ for literature ICSRs  which are based on an  analysis from a competent authority database within  the  EU. The reporting requirements remain for th ose ICSRs which are based on the analysis from a  competent authority database outside the EU ;  â¢ for literature articles,  which present data analyses from publicly available databases or, which  summarise results from post -authorisation studie s (see VI.C.1.2 .). This type of literature article  describes  adverse reactions , which occur  in a group of patients with a designated medicinal  product  with the aim of identifying or quantifying a safety hazard  related to a medicinal product,   and aggregated data on patients are often  presented in tables or line listings . The main objective  of those studies is to detect/evaluate specific risks that could affect the overall risk -benefit balance  of a medicinal prod uct.   New and significant safety findings presented in these articles , for which reporting is not required ,  should however be discussed in the relevant sections of the concerned periodic safety update report  (see Module VII ) and analysed as regards their overall impact on the medicinal product risk -benefit  profile. In addition, any new safety information, which ma y impact on the risk -benefit profile of a  medicinal product, should be notified immediately to the competent authorities in Member States  where the medicinal product is authorised and to the Agency in accordance with the recommendations  provided in VI.C.2.2.6 ..  A detailed guidance on the monitoring of the scientific and medical literature has been developed in  accordance with Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004;  it is included in VI. Appendix  2.   The electronic reporting recommendation s regarding suspected adverse reactions reports published in  the scientific and medical  literature are provided in VI.C.6.2.3.2 ..  VI.C.2.2. 4. Suspected adverse rea ctions related to quality def ect or falsified medicinal  products   When a report of suspected adverse reactions is associated with  a suspected or confirmed  falsified  medicinal product or  quality defect of a medicinal product, a valid ICSR should be reported. The  seriousness of the ICSR is linked to the seriousness of the reported suspected adverse reactions in  accor dance with the definitions provided in VI.A.2.4 .. Electronic reporting recommen dations provided  in VI.C.6.2.3.5 . should be followed.    Guideline on good ph armacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 27/90     In addition in order to protect public health, it may become necessary to implement urgent measures  such as the recall of one or more defective batc h(es) of a medicinal product from the market.  Therefore, marketing authorisation holders should have a system in place to ensure that reports of  suspected adverse reactions related to falsified medicinal products or to quality defects of a medicinal produc ts are investigated in a timely fashion and that confirmed quality defects are notified separately  to the manufacturer and to competent authorities in accordance with the provisions described in Article  13 of Directive 2003/94/EC .  VI.C.2.2.5. Suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent   For the purposes of reporting, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal  produc t should be considered as a serious adverse reaction and such case s should be reported within  15 days  in accordance with the requirements outlined in VI.C.4 . 29. If no other criterion is applicable ,  the seriousness  of this ICSR should be considered as important m edical event (s ee VI.A.2.4 .). This also  applies to vaccines.  Electronic reporting recommendations provided in VI.C.6.2 .3.6. should be followed.    In the case of medicinal products derived from human blood or human plasma, haemovigilance  procedures may also apply in accordance with Directive 2002/98/EC . Therefore the marketing  authorisation holder  should have a system in place to communicate suspected transmission via a  medicinal product of an infectious agent to the manufacturer, the relevant blood establishment(s) and  national competent authorities in Member States .  Any organism, virus or infectious particle (e.g. prion protein transmitting t ransmissible spongiform  encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent.   A transmission of an infect ious agent may be suspected from clinical signs or symptoms, or laboratory  findings indicating an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.   Emphasis should be on the detection of infections/infectious agents known to be potentially  transmitte d via a medicinal product, but the occurrence of unknown agents should also always be  considered.   In the context of evaluating a suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product,  care should be taken to discriminate, whenever possible, between  the cause (e.g.  injection/   admin istration) and the source (e.g.  contamination) of the infection and the clinical conditions  of the  patient at the time of the infection  (immuno -suppressed /vaccinee).   Confirmation of contamination (including inade quate inactivation/attenuation of infectious agents as  active substances) of the concerned medicinal product increases the evidence for transmission of an  infectious agent and may therefore be suggestive of a quality defect  for which the procedures detaile d  in VI.C.2.2.4 . should be applied.   Medicinal products should comply with the recommendations provided in the Note for Guidance on  Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Sp ongiform Encephalopathy Age nts via Human and  Veterinary Products30. For advanced therapy medicinal products, Article 14(5)  of Regulation (EC) No  1394/2007  and the Guideline on Safety  and Efficacy Follow -up - Risk Management of Advanced  Therapy Medicinal Products31, should also be followed as appropriate .                                                   29 See VI.C.6.2.3.6 . for electronic reporting recommendations.   30 Latest revision .

Emerging safety issues  Events may occur, which do not fall within the definition of reportable valid ICSRs, and thus are not  subject to the reporting requirements, even though they may lead to changes  in the known risk -benefit  balance of a medicinal product  and/or impact on public health . Examples include :  â¢ major safety findings from a newly completed non -clinical study;  â¢ major safety concerns identified in the course of a non-interventional post-authorisation study or of  a clinical trial;   â¢ signal of a possible teratogen  effect or of significant hazard to public health;   â¢ safety issues publis hed in the scientific and medical  literature;   â¢ safety issues arising from the signal detection activity  (see Module IX) or emerging from a new  ICSR and which impact on the risk -benefit balance of the medicinal product  and/or have  implications for public health ;  â¢ safety issues related to the use outside the terms of the marketing authorisation;   â¢ safety issues due to misinformation in the product information ;  â¢ marketing authorisation withdrawal, non -renewal, revocation or suspension outside the EU for  safety -related reasons;  â¢ urgent safety restrictions outside the EU ;  â¢ safety issues in relation to the supply of ra w material;   â¢ lack of supply of medicines .  These events/observations , which may affect the risk -benefit balance of a medicinal product, are  not to  be submitted as ICSRs. They should be notified  as emerging safety issues in writing to the competent  authorities in Member States where the medicinal product i s authorised and to the Agency  via email  (P-PV-emerging- safety -issue@ema.europa.eu ); this should be done  immediately when becoming   aware of them . The document should indicate the points of concern and the actions proposed in  relation to the marketing  application/ authorisation  for the concerned medicinal product . Those safety  issues should also be analysed in the relevant sections of the periodic safety update report of the  authorised medicinal product.   VI.C.2.2.7. Period between the s ubmission of the m arketing authorisation application and  the granting of the m arketing authorisation   In the period between the submission of the marketing authorisation application and the granting of  the marketing  authorisation , information  (quality, non -clinical , clinical ) that could impact on the risk - benefit balance  of the medicinal product under evaluation  may b ecome available to the applicant32. It  is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that this information is immediately submitted  in  accordance with the modalities described in VI.C.2.2. 6. to the competent authorities in  the Me mber  States where the application is under assessment (including Reference Member  State and all  concerned Member States for products assessed under the mutual recognition or decentralised  procedures)  and to the Agency . For appl ications  under the centralised procedure, the information  should  also be provided to the (Co-) Rapporteur.                                                    32 See also chapter 1, section 5.1.1 of Volume 2A (Notice to Applicants) of The Rules Governing Medicinal Produ cts in the  European Union.  http://ec.europa.eu/health/documents/eudralex/vol- 2/index_en.htm.    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 29/90     In the situation where a medicinal product application is under evaluation in the EU while it has already  been authorised in a third country, v alid ICSRs from outside the EU , originating from unsolicited  reports (see VI.B.1.1 .) or solicited reports (s ee VI.B.1.2 .), should be reported in accordance with the  requirements provided in VI.C.3 ., VI.C.4 . and VI.C.6 ..   VI.C.2.2.8. Period after suspension, revocation or withdrawal of marketing authorisation   The marketing authorisation holder  shall continue to collect any  reports of  suspected advers e reaction s  related to the concerned medicinal product following the suspension of a marketing authorisation. The  reporting requirements outlined  in VI.C.4 . remain.   Where a marketing authorisation is withdrawn or revoked, the former marketing authorisation holder  is  encouraged to continue to collect spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions originating  within the EU to for example  facilitate the review of delayed onset adverse reactions or  of  retrospective ly notified cases.   VI.C.2.2.9. Period during a public health emergency   A public health emergency is a public health threat duly recognised either by the World Health  Organization (WHO) or the Community in the framework of Decision No. 2119/98/EC  as amended  of  the European Parliament and of the Council. In the event of a public health emergency, regular  reporting requirements may be amended. Such arrangem ents will be considered on a case -by-case  basis and will be appropriately notified on the Agency website.   VI.C.2.2.10. Reports from class action law suits   Stimulated r eport s arising from class action law suits should be managed  as spontaneous  reports. Valid  ICSRs  should  describe adverse reactions related to the concerned  medicinal product. They  should be  reported in accordance with the time frames and modalities described in VI.C.3 ., VI.C.4 . and VI.C.6 ..  Where large batches of potential ICSRs are received, marketing authorisation holders may request , in  exceptional circumstances, for  an exemption in order to submit serious cases of suspected adverse  reactions within 30 days from their date of receipt instead of 15 days. The 90 days reporting time  frame for non -serious ICSRs remains unchanged. It will be possible to apply for t his exemption  only  once the functionalities of the Eudr aVigilance database specified in Article 24(2) of Regulation (EC) No  726/2004 are established. The request should be made to the Agency âs pharmacovigilance  department .  VI.C.2.2.1 1. Reports from p atient support programme s and market research programme s  A patient support programme is an organised system  where a marketing authorisation holder receives   and collects  information relating to the use of its  medicinal product s. Examples are post -authorisation  patient support and disease management programmes, survey s of patients and healthcare providers,  information gathering on patient compliance, or compensation/re -imbursement schemes.   A market research programme refers to  the systematic collection, recording and analysis by a  marketing authorisation holder of dat a and findings  about its medicinal products , relevant for   marketing and business development.   Safety reports originating from those programmes should be considered as solicited reports. Marketing  authorisation holders should have the same mechanism s in pla ce as for  all other  solicited reports  (see  VI.C.2.2.2 .) to manage that information  and report valid cases of adverse reactions,  which are  suspected to be related to  the concerned medicinal product.    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 30/90     Valid ICSRs  shoul d be reported as solicited  in accordance with the electronic reporting requirements  provided in VI.C.6.2.3.7 ..  VI.C.3. Reporting time frames   The g eneral rules in relation to the reporting  of initial and follow -up reports , including those for   defining the c lock start are detailed in  VI.B.7..  According to Articles 107(3) and 107a(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC ,   â¢ serious valid ICSRs shall be reported by competent authorities in Member States or by marketing  authorisation holders within 15 days from the  date of receipt of the reports;   â¢ non-serious valid ICSRs shall  be reported by competent authorities in  Member States or  by  marketing authorisation holders within 90 days from the  date of receipt of the reports .   This should be done in accordance with the reporting modalities detailed in VI.C.4 ..  VI.C.4. Reporting modalities   In addition to the recommendations provided in VI.B.8., competent authorities in Member States and  marketing authorisation holders  shall use the format s, standards and terminologies  for the electronic  transmission of suspected adverse reactions as referred to in  chapter  IV of the Commission  Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012. ICSRs shall be used for reporting to the Eudravigilance  database suspected adverse reactions to a medicinal product that occur in a single patient at a specific  point in time  [IR Art 27 ]. Competent a uthorities in Member States and marketing authorisation holders   shall also ensure that all  reported electronic ICSRs are well documented and as complete as possible in  accordance with the requirements provided in [ IR Art 28].   The time frames for reporting serious and non- serious valid ICSRs are provided in VI.C.3 .. The  recommendations provided in  VI.C.6. should be adhered  to as regards the electronic exchange of  pharmacovi gilance information between competent authorities in  Member States, marketing  authorisation holders  and the Agency.   ICSRs reported electronically  to the EudraVigilance database  will be made accessible to stakeholders  such as competent authorities , healthca re professionals,  consumers, as well as marketing authorisation  holders  and research organisations in accordance with Article 24(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  and the EudraVigilance Access Policy for Medicines for Human Use33. This p olicy defines the ov erall  principles of the provision of access to EudraVigilance data in line with the current legal framework ,  while guaranteeing personal data protection . As detailed in  the EudraVigilance access policy , a  selection of ICSRs c ould be downloaded by marketing  authorisation holders in ICH E2B format and in  accordance with the ICH M2 message specifications, t o facilitate their pharmacovigilance activities.   VI.C.4.1. Interim  arrangement s  In accordance with the provisions set out in Article 2 (4), Article 2(5)  and Article 2(6)  of Directive  2010/84/ EU, until the Agency can ensure the functionalities of the EudraVigilance database as  specified in Article 24(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the following reporting requirements shall   apply to valid unsolicited and solicited ICSRs  reported by healthcare professional s and non- healthcare  professional s. This is independently of the condition of use of the suspected medicinal product and of  the expectedness of the adverse reaction .                                                   33 http://www.ema.europa.eu    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 31/90     a. Serious ICSRs   â¢ Marketing authorisation h olders  shall report all serious ICSRs that occur in the EU to the competent  authority of the Member State on whose territory the suspected adverse reaction s occur red.  â¢ Marketing authorisation holders shall report  to the EudraVigilance database all serious I CSRs that  occur outside  the EU , including those received from competent authorities . If required  by Member  States , those reports sh all also be submitted to the competent authorities in the Member States  in  which the medicinal product is authorised.   â¢ Competent authorities in Member State s shall ensure that all serious ICSRs that occur in their  territory and that are reported to them, including those received from marketing authorisation  holders, are  made available to the EudraVigilance database.  Competent aut horities in Member  States should also make available , to the marketing authorisation holders of the suspected  medicinal products, all serious ICSRs  reported directly to them .  b. Non-Serious ICSRs   â¢ If required by Member States , marketing authorisation holder s shall report all non -serious ICSRs  that occur in the EU to the competent authority of  the Member State on who se territory the  suspected adverse reactions occurred .  Overviews  of the reporting requirements of serious and non -serious reports during the inte rim period,   applicable to marketing authorisation holders or competent authorities in Member States, are   presented in VI.App 3.1., together with a detailed business process map.   Member States reporting requirem ents for serious non -EU ICSRs and for non- serious EU ICSRs are also   included in  this Appendix .   VI.C.4.2. Final arrangement s  Once the functionalities of the EudraVigilance database specified in Article 24(2) of Regulation (EC) No  726/2004 are established,  the following requirements , detailed in Articles 107(3) and 107a(4) of  Directive 2001/83/EC , shall apply within 6 months of the announcement by the Agency  to valid  unsolicited and solicited ICSRs reported by healthcare professional s and non- healthcare prof essional s.  This is  independently of the condition of use of the suspected medicinal product and of the  expectedness of the adverse reaction .  a. Serious ICSRs   â¢ Marketing authorisation holders shall submit  all serious ICSRs that occur  within or outside the EU ,  including those received from competent authorit ies outside the EU , to the EudraVigilance database  only.  â¢ Competent authorities in Member States shall submit  to the EudraVigilance database  all serious  ICSRs  that occur  in their territory  and that are direc tly reported to them .  b. Non-Serious ICSRs    â¢ Marketing authorisation holders shall submit  all non-serious ICSRs that occur in the EU  to the  EudraVigilance database only .  â¢ Competent authorities in Member States shall submit  all non-serious ICSRs that occur  in their  territory  to the EudraVigilance database .   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 32/90     Overviews  of the reporting requirements of serious and non -serious reports, applicable to marketing  authorisation holders or compete nt authorities in Member States  once the final arrangement s are  implemented,  are presented in VI.App 3.2., together with a detailed business process map.   In accord ance with the requirement detailed  in Article 24(4)  of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for the  final arrangements , the ICSRs sub mitted to the EudraVigilance database by marketing authorisation  holders shall be automatically  transmitted  upon receipt , to the competent authority of the Member  State where the reaction occurred. A d etailed business process map  is included in VI.App 3.3..  VI.C.5. Collaboration with the World Health Organization and the European  Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction  The Agency shall make available to the WHO (in practice the WHO  Collabora ting Cent re for  International Drug Monitoring ) all suspected adverse reaction reports occurring in the EU  [REG Art  28c(1)]. This will take place on a weekly basis  after their transmission to the EudraVigilance database  by competent authorities in Member States or marketing authorisation holders . It will replace the  requirements of Member States participating in the WHO Programme for International Drug Monitoring  to directly report to WHO suspected adverse reaction s reports occurring in their territory . This will be  implemented once the functionalities of the EudraVigilance database specified in Article 24(2) of  Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 are established .  A detailed business process map  for the reporting of ICSRs, from the EudraVigilance database to the  WHO Collabora ting Centre  for International Drug Monitoring , is presented in VI. Appendix  4.  The Agency and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction shall  also exchange  information that they receive on  the abuse of medicinal products including information related to illicit  drugs  [REG Art 28c (2)].  VI.C.6. El ectronic exchange of safety information in the EU   VI.C.6 . highlights  the requirements , as defined in Articles 24(1) and 24(3) of Regulation (EC) No  726/2004,  for the establishment and maintenance of the European database and data processing  network (the EudraVigilance database) in order to collate and share pharmacovigilance information  electronically between competent authorities in Member States, ma rketing authorisation holder s and  the Agency, in ways which ensure the quality and integrity of the data collected .  The information provided here is relevant for the electronic exchange  of ICSRs in  the EU  between all  stakeholders  and for the electronic sub mission of information on medicinal products to the Agency .   VI.C.6.1. Applicable guidelines, definitions , international formats,  standards and terminologies   For the classification, retrieval, presentation, risk -benefit evaluation and assessment, electron ic  exchange and communication of pharmacovigilance and medicinal product information, Member States, marketing authorisation holders and the Agency sh all adher e to the legal requirements   provided in c hapter IV of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)  No 520/2012.   In addition the following guidelines should be applied:   â¢ Note for guidance -  EudraVigilance Human -  Processing of Safety M essages and Individual Case  Safety Reports (ICSRs)  (EMA/H/20665/04/Final Rev. 2 ) (EudraVigilance Business Rules);    Guideline on good pharmacovi gilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 33/90     â¢ Note for Guidance on the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) of Individual Case Safety Reports  (ICSRs) and Medicinal Products (MPRS) in  Pharmacovigilance during the pre-  and post - authorisation phase in the European economic area (EEA)  (EMEA/115735/2004 );  â¢ The ICH guidelines detailed in VI.B.8 .;  â¢ The ICH-M5 guideline âRoutes of Administration Controlled Vocabularyâ  (CHMP/ICH/175860/2005 ),  which provides standard terms for routes of administration;   The latest version of these documents should always be considered .  VI.C.6.2. Electronic reporting of individual case safety reports   The reporting of valid ICSRs  electronically , by competent authorities in Member States and marketing  authorisation holders , is mandatory for all medicinal products authorised in the EU  [DIR Art 107(3), Art  107a(4) ]. Non -adherence to this requirement constitutes a non-compliance with EU legislation.   Responsibilities in case of communication failure  (including adherence  to compliance  for reporting) are  detailed in c hapter IV of the Note for Guidance on the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) of Individual  Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) and Medi cinal Product Reports (MPRs) in Pharmacovigilance during the  Pre- and Post -authorisation Phase in the European Economic Area (EEA)  (EMEA/115735/2004 ).   Technical tools (EVWEB) have been made available by the Agency to interested el ectronic data  interchange  partners, including  small and medium -sized enterprises, to facilitate compliance with the  electronic reporting requirements  as defined in EU legislation.  Information is available on  EudraVigilance website34.   VI.C.6.2.1. EudraVigilance Database Modules   Two modules are available in the EudraVigilance  database  to address the collection of reports of  suspected adverse reactions re lated to medicinal products for human use, in accordance with EU  legislation:   â¢ EudraVigilance Post -Authorisation Module (EVPM) , implemented based on  the requirements  defined  in Regul ation (EC) No 726/2004 and Directive 2001/83/EC ; and  â¢ EudraVigilance  Clinica l Trial Module (EVCTM), implemented based on the requirements defined in  Directive 2001/20/EC .  VI.C.6.2.1.1. Adverse reaction data collect ed in the EudraVigilance Post -Author isation  Module   The adverse reaction reports collected in the EudraVigilance Post -Authorisation Module ( EVPM ) refer to  unsolicited  reports  and solicited reports which do not fall under the scope of the Clinica l Trials Directive  2001/20/EC (s ee VI.C.1 .). The ICSRs should be submitted with the va lue 'EVHUMAN' in the  data  element  âMessage receiver identifier â (ICH M2 M.1.6).   Depending on their type , these ICSRs  should be classified  with one of the following options , in  accordance with the EudraVigilance Business Rules35:  â¢ Data element âType of report â (ICH-E2B(R2) A.1.4) :  â spontaneous report ;                                                   34 http://eudravigilance.ema.europa.eu   35 Note for guidance -  EudraVigilance Human -  Processing of Safety Messages and Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs)   (EMA/H/20665 /04/Final Rev. 2 ).

VI.C.6.2.1.2. Adverse reaction data collected in the EudraVigilance Clinical Trial Module    Only cases of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs ), related to investigational  medicinal products  studied in clinical trials  which fall  under the scope of  Directive 2001/20/ EC (see  VI.C.1 .), should be reported by the sponsor to t he EudraVigilance Clinical Trial Module (EVCTM) . The  requirements provided in c hapter II of EudraLex Volume 10 of The Rules Governing Medicinal Products  in the European Union  should be applied . The ICSRs should be submitted with the value 'EVCTMPROD'  in the data element âM essage receiver identifier â (ICH M2 M.1.6) and should be  classified as followed ,  in accordance with the EudraVigilance Business Rules36:  â¢ data element âType of reportâ (ICH -E2B(R2) A.1.4):   â report from study ; and  â¢ data element âStudy type in w hich the reaction(s)/event(s) w ere observedâ (ICH -E2B(R2) A.2.3.3):   â clinical tr ials.  VI.C.6.2.2. Preparation of individual case safety reports   VI.C.6.2.2.1. General principles   The content of e ach valid ICSR transmitted electronically  between all stakeholders should comply with  the legal requirements and guidelines detailed in  the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No  520/2012 and in VI.C.6.1 ., particularly:   â¢ the requirements provided  in chapter s IV and V  of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)  No 520/2012;   â¢ the latest version of the ICH-Endorsed Guide for MedDRA U sers - MedDRA Term Selection: Points  to Consider Document  (see GVP Annex IV );  â¢ the EudraVigilance business rules for the electronic transmission of ICSRs detailed in the Note for  Guidance - EudraV igilance Human -  Processing of Safety Messages and Individual Case S afety  Reports (ICSRs) (EMA/H/20665/04/Final Rev. 2 ).  It is recognised that it is often difficult to obtain all the details on a specific case. Howe ver, the  complete information  (medical and administrative data) for a valid  ICSR that is available to the sender  should  be reported in a struct ured manner in the relevant ICH -E2B(R2) data elements  (see GVP Annex  IV) (which should be repeated as necessary  when multiple  information is available ) and in the                                                   36 See Footnote 38 .   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 35/90     narrative section (see VI.C.6.2.2.4 .). This applies to all types of ICSRs, such as  reports with initial  information on the case, follow -up information  and cases highlighted for nullification37.   In the situation where it is evident that the sender has not transmitted the complete information  available on the case , the receiver may request the sender to re- transmit the ICSR within 24 hours  with the complete case information in electronic format in accordance with the requirements applicable  for the electronic reporting of ICSRs. This sh ould be seen in the light of the qualitative signal detection  and evaluation  activity , where it is important for the receiver to have all the available information on a  case to perform the medical assessment  (see VI.C.6.2.4 .).  Where the suspected adverse reaction s reported in a single  ICSR impact on the known risk -benefit  balance of a medicinal product, this should be considered as  an emerging safety issue (see  VI.C.2.2.6 .), which  should be immediately notified in writing  to the competent authorities of the  Member States where the medicinal product is authorised and to the Agency. This is i n addition to the  reporting requirements detailed in VI.C.4 .. A summary of the points of concerns and the action  proposed should be recorded in the ICSR in data element âSenderâs commentsâ (ICH -E2B(R2) B.5.4).   VI.C.6.2.2.2. Information on suspect, interacting  and concomitant medicinal products   The suspect, interacting and/or concomitant active substances /invented name s of the reported  medicinal products  should be provided in accordance with IR Art 28 (3) (g) to (i), ICH-E2B(R2) (see  GVP Annex IV ) and the EudraVigilance Business Rules.   The characterisation of medicinal products as suspect, interacting or concomitant is based on the  information provided by primary source.   For combination medicinal products, which contain more than one active substance, each active substance needs to be reflected individually in the data element âActive substance name(s)â (ICH E2B(R2) B.4.k.2.2), which needs to be repeated for each active s ubstance contained in the  combination medicinal product.   When the primary source reports a suspect or interacting branded/proprietary medicinal product name  without indicating the active substance (s) of the medicinal product and where the proprietary  medic inal product can be one of two or more possible generics, which have a different composition  depending on the country where the medicinal product is marketed, the ICSR should be populated as  follows:   â¢ data element 'Proprieta ry medicinal product name' (ICH -E2B(R2) B.4.k.2.1) should be populated  with the proprietary/branded medicinal product name as reported by the primary source;   â¢ data element 'Active substance name(s)' (ICH -E2B(R2) B.4.k.2.2) should be completed with th e  active substance (s) that correspond (s) to the composition of the proprietary/branded medicinal  product of the country where the reaction/event occurred.   However i f the information is available on :  â¢ the 'Identification of the country where the drug was obtained' (data  element ICH E2B(R2)  B.4.k. 2.3),  â¢ the 'Authorization/application number' (data  element ICH -E2B(R2) B.4.k.4.1),   â¢ the 'Country of authorization/application' (data element ICH -E2B(R2) B.4.k.4.2) , and/or   â¢ the 'Batch/lot number' (dat a element ICH -E2B(R2) B.4.k.3),                                                    37 See also VI.C.6.2.2.10 . on nullification of individual cases.

Where the primary source reports a suspect or interacting branded/proprietary medicinal product name  without indicating the pharmaceutical form/presentation of the product and where the  proprietary/branded medicinal product can be one of two or more possible pharmaceutical  forms/presentations, which have different composition s in a country , the ICSR should be populated as  follows:   â¢ data element 'Proprieta ry medici nal product name' (ICH -E2B(R2) B.4.k.2.1) should be populated  with the medicinal product name as reported by the primary source;   â¢ data element 'Active substance name(s)' (ICH-E2B(R2) B.4.k.2.2) should be completed with those  active substances which are in common to all pharmaceutical forms/presentations in the country of  authorisation.   Where medicinal products cannot be described on the basis of the active substances or the invented  name s, for example when  only the therapeutic class is reported by the primar y source, or  in case of  other administered therapies that cannot be structured, this information should only be reflected in t he  case narrative  (data element ICH -E2B(R2) B.5.1) . The data elements âProprietary medicinal product  nameâ (ICH -E2B(R2) B.4.k.2.1)  and âActive substance name(s)â (ICH -E2B(R2) B.4.k.2.2) should not be  populated.  The same applies if a suspected food interaction is reported (e.g.  to grapefruit juice).   Where  a case of  adverse reaction s is reported to be related only to a therapeutic cla ss, it is considered  incomplete and does not qu alify for reporting (s ee VI.B.2.). Efforts should be made  to follow -up the  case in order to collect the missing information regarding the  suspected medicinal product (see  VI.B.3 .).   As regards the reporting of drug interactions, which concerns  drug/drug (including biological products),  drug/food, drug/device, and drug/alcohol interactions, the coding of the interaction should be   performed in s ection âReactions/Eventsâ (ICH -E2B(R2) B.2) in line with the latest version of the ICH- Endorsed Guide for MedDRA U sers - MedDRA Term Selection: Points to Consider Document  (see GVP  Annex IV ). In addition, for drug/drug interactions, information on the active su bstances/ proprietary  medicinal product  name s should be provided in the s ection âDrug informationâ ( ICH-E2B(R2)  B.4),  which should be characterised  as interacting  in the data element âChar acterisation of drug roleâ (ICH - E2B(R2) B.4.k.1) .   If the primary source suspects a possible causal role of one of the ingredients  (e.g., excipient or  adjuvant)  of the suspected medicinal product, this information should be provided in the section âDrug  informationâ ( ICH-E2B(R2) B.4 ) as a separate entry  in addition to the information given regarding the  suspected medicinal product . This  should also be specified  in the case narrative (data element ICH - E2B(R2) B.5.1) . If available, test s results (positive or negative) in relation to the causal role  of the  suspected ingredient should be included in t he section 'Results of tests and procedures relevant to the  investigation of the patient'  (ICH E2B(R2) B.3).   VI.C.6.2.2.3. Suspected adverse re action s  All available information as described in [I R Art 28 (3)  (j)] shall be provided for each individual case.  The coding of diagnoses and provisional diagnoses with signs and symptoms in the data element  'Reaction/event in MedDRA terminology (Lowest Le vel Term)' (ICH -E2B(R2) B.2.i.1) should be  performed in line with the latest version of the ICH-Endorsed Guide for MedDRA Users, MedDRA Term  Selection: Points to Consider  (see GVP Annex IV ).    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 37/90     In practice, if a diagnosis is reported with characteristic signs and symptoms, the preferred option  is to  select a term for the diagnosis only  and to MedDRA code it  in the ICH -E2B(R2) section B.2  'Reaction(s)/event(s)' . If no diagnosis is provided, all reported signs and symptoms should be lis ted  and MedDRA coded in the ICH -E2B(R2) section B.2 'Reaction(s)/event(s)'. I f these signs and  symptoms are typically part of a diagnosis , the diagnosis can be  MedDRA coded  in addition  by  competent authorities i n Member States or marketing authorisation holders  in the ICH -E2B(R2) data  element  B.5.3 âSender's diagnosis/syndrome and/or reclassification of reaction/event '.   If in the narrative other events have been reported, which are not typically signs or symptom s of the  primary source's diagnosis or provisional diagnosis, and those events are suspected to be adverse  reactions, they should also be lis ted and MedDRA coded in the ICH -E2B(R2) section B.2  'Reaction(s)/event(s)'.   In case  a competent authority  in a Memb er State or a marketing authorisation holder  disagrees  with  the diagnosis reported  by the primary source, an alternative diagnosis can  be provided in the ICH - E2B(R2)  data element  B.5.3 âSender's diagnosis/syndrome and/or reclassification of reaction/event â in  addition  to the reported diagnosis provided in the ICH -E2B(R2) section B.2 'Reaction(s)/event(s)' . In  this situation, a  reasoning should be included in the data element âSenderâs commentsâ (ICH -E2B(R2)  B.5.4)  (see VI.C.6.2.2.4 .).  In the event of death of the patient, the  date, cause of death including autopsy -determined causes  shall be provided as available  [IR 28 ( 3) (l)]. If the death is unrelated to the reported suspected  adverse reaction (s) and is linked for example to disease progression , the seriousness criterion of the  ICSR should not be considered as fatal; the recommendation provided in the EudraVigilance Business  Rules  should be followed.   VI.C.6.2.2.4. Case narrative , causality assessment  and comments   In accordance with [IR Art  28 (3) (m)], a case narrative (data element ICH -E2B(R2)  B.5.1) shall be  provided, where poss ible38, for all cases with the exception of non -serious cases. The information shall  be presented in a logical time sequence, in the chronology of the patientâs experience including clinical course, therapeutic measures, outcome and follow -up information ob tained.  Any relevant autopsy or  post-mortem findings shall also be summarised .  The narrative  should be presented in line with the recommendations described in c hapter 5.2 of ICH - E2D (see GVP Annex IV ). In this aspect, it should serve as a comprehensive, st and-alone âmedical  reportâ containing all known relevant clinical and related information, including patient characteristics,  therapy details, medical history, clinical course of the event(s), diagnosis, adverse reactions and their  outcomes, relevant labor atory evidence (including normal ranges) and any other information that  supports or refutes the  suspected adverse reaction s. An example of a standard narrative template is  available  in the Report of the CIOMS Working Group V39.   The information provided in the narrative  should be consistent with the data appropriately  reflected in  all the other relevant ICH -E2B(R2) data elements of the ICSR  (see GVP Annex IV) .   During the interim arrangements (see VI.C.4.1 .), the case narratives included  in the ICSRs submitted  to the competent authorities in Member States  by marketing authorisation holder s, should not be  modifie d or deleted when the ICSRs are forwarded to the EudraVigilance dat abase by the competent  authori ties.                                                   38 âWhere possibleâ should be interpreted as having received sufficient information from the primary sou rce to prepare a  concise clinical summary of the individual case.   39 Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS).

Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 38/90     Where available, comments from the primary source on the diagnosis, causality assessment or other  relevant issue, should be provided in the data element âReporterâs  commentsâ (ICH -E2B(R2) B.5. 2).  Competent authorities in Member States and marketing a uthorisation holders may provide an  assessment of the case and describe a disagreement with, and/or alternatives to the diagnoses given  by the primary source  (see VI.C.6.2.2.3 .). This should be done in the data element âSenderâs  commentsâ (ICH -E2B(R2) B.5.4) , where discrepancies or confusion s in the information  notified  by the  primary source  may also be highlighted.  Where applicable, a summary of the points of concerns and  action s proposed should also be  included in the data element âSenderâs commentsâ (ICH -E2B(R2)  B.5.4) , if the ICSR leads to notification of an e merging safety issue (see VI.C.2.2.6 .). The degree of  suspected relatedness of each medicinal produ ct to the adverse reaction(s) may be indicated in the  data element âRelatedness of drug to reaction(s)/event(s)â (ICH -E2B(R2) B.4.k.18), which should be  repeated as necessary. This also allows presenting the degree of relatedness from different sources or   with different  methods of assessment.   VI.C.6.2.2.5. Test results   Results of tests and procedures relevant to the investigation of the patient shall be provided [IR Art 28  (3) (k)].   As described in  ICH-E2B(R2)  (see GVP Annex IV ), the section B.3 'Results of  tests and procedures  relevant to the investigation of the patient' should capture the tests and procedures performed to  diagnose or confirm the reaction/event, including those tests done to investigate (exclude) a non -drug  cause, (e.g., serologic tests fo r infectious hepatitis in suspected drug -induced hepatitis). Both positive  and negative results should be reported.   The coding of investigations should be performed in line with the latest version of the ICH-Endorsed  Guide for MedDRA Users, MedDRA Term Selection: Points to Consider  (see GVP Annex IV) . If it is not  possible to provide information on tests and test results in a structured manner , provisions have been  made to  allow for the  transmi ssion of  the information as fr ee text in the data element ICH -E2B(R2)  B.3.2. 'Results of tests and procedures relevant to the investigation'.   VI.C.6.2.2.6. Supplementary information   Key information from supplementary records should be provided in th e relevant section of the ICSR ,  and their availability should be mentioned in the data element âList of  documents held by senderâ (ICH - E2B(R2)  A.1.8.2).   Other known case identifiers relevant for the detection of duplicates should be presented  systematical ly in the data element âOther case identifiers in previous transmissionsâ (ICH -E2B(R2)  A.1.11).  VI.C.6.2.2.7. Follow -up information   ICSRs are sent at different times to multiple receiver s. Therefore the initial/follow -up status is  dependent  upon the receiv er. For this reason an item to capture follow -up status is not included in the  ICH-E2B(R2)  data elements. However, the data element  âDate of receipt of the most recent information  for this reportâ ( ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.7) taken together with the data element  âSender identifierâ ( ICH  E2B(R2)  A.3.1.2) and  the data element âS enderâs (case) report unique identifierâ ( ICH-E2B(R2)   A.1.0.1) provide a mechanism for each receiver to identify  whether the report being transmitted is an  initial or a follow -up report. For th is reason these items are  considered critical for each transmission  and a precise date should always be used (i.e. day, month, year).  The data element âDate of receipt of  the most recent information for this reportâ (ICH -E2B(R2) A.1.7)  should therefore always be updated   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 39/90     each time a follow -up information is received by a competent authority or a marketing authorisation  holder , independently whether the follow -up information received is significant enough to be reported .  The data element âDate report was firs t received from the sourceâ (ICH -E2B(R2) A.1. 6) should remain  unchanged to the date the  competent authority or the marketing authorisation holder became aware of  the initial report .  New information should be clearly identifiable in the case narrative (data element ICH -E2B(R2) B.5.1)  and provided in a structured format in the applicable ICH -E2B(R2)  data elements .  Competent authorities in Member States or marketing authorisation holders  should report follow -up  information if significant new medical information has been received. Significant new information  relates to for example new suspected adverse reaction(s), a change in the causality assessment and  any new or updated information on the case that impacts on its  medical interpretation. Therefore, the  identi fication of significant new information requiring to be reported always necessitate s medical   judgement.   Situations where the seriousness criteria and/or the causality assessment are downgraded (e.g. follow - up information leads to a change of the seriousnes s criteria from serious to non -serious; causality  assessment is changed from related to non -related) should also be  considered as significant change s  and thus reported  (see VI.B.7.1 . for reporting time frames) .  In addition, competent authorities in Member States or marketing authorisation holders should also  report follow -up information, where new administrative information is available, that could impact on  the case management ; for example,  if new case identif iers have become known to the sender, which  may have been used in previous transmissions (data element  âOther case identifiers in previous  transmissionsâ  (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.11) ). This information may be specifically relevant to manage  potential duplicates. A nother example refers to data element âAdditional available documents held by  sender â (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.8) , whereby new documents that have become available to the sender may  be relevant for the medical assessment of the case.   In contrast, a follow -up repor t which contain s non-significant information  does not require to be  report ed. This may refer , for exa mple, to minor changes to some  dates in the case with no implication  for the evaluation  or transmission  of the case , or corrections of typographical errors  in the previous  case version.  Medical judge ment should be applied since a change to the birth date may  constitute a  significant modification  (e.g. with implications on the age information of the patient).  Similarly, a   change of the status of a MedDRA code /term from current to non -current , due to a version change of  MedDRA , can be considered as a non -significant change as long as this change has no impact on the  medica l content of a case. However, an amendment of the MedDRA coding due to a change in the  interpretation of a previously reported suspected adverse reaction may constitute a significant change  and therefore should be reported.   In situations where the case is modified  without impacting  on its medical evaluation, while no new  follow -up is received ( e.g., for correcting a mistake  or typographical error ), the date of receipt of the  most recent information reported in the data element âDate of receipt of the most recent in formation  for this reportâ (ICH -E2B(R2) A.1.7 ) should not be changed. T his data e lement should  however  be  updated in any other situations , to the date when new follow -up information is received ( independently  whether it is significant or not) or to the date when changes are made  which impact on the   interpretation  of the case .  Where fol low-up information of a case initially reported by a marketing authorisation holder is received   directly  by a competent authority, the âWorldwide unique c ase identification numberâ (ICH -E2B(R2)  A.1.10) of the initial report should be mainta ined, in adheren ce with ICH -E2B(R2) (see GVP Annex IV ).   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 40/90     The same principle should be applied if a follow -up is received by a marketing authorisation holder of a  case initially reported by a competent authority .   VI.C.6.2.2.8. What to take into account for data privacy law s  To detect, assess, understand and prevent adverse reactions and to identify , and take actions to  reduce the risks of, and increase the benefits from medicinal products for the purpose of safeguarding  public health, the processing of personal data within the EudraVigilance database is possible while  respecting EU legislation in relation to data protection (Directive 95/46/EC, Regulation (EC)  No  45/2001).   Where in accordance with applicable national legislation, information related to personal data  cannot  be transferred to the EudraVigilance database , pseudonymisation may be applied by competent  authorities in Member States and by marketing authorisation holders, thereby replacing identifiable  personal  data such as name and address with pseudonyms or key co des, for example in accordance  with the ISO Technical Specification DD  ISO/TS 25237:2008, Health informatics â  Pseudonymization   [IR Recital 17 ]. The application of pseudonymisation will facilitate the ability of the EudraVigilance  system to adequately support case processing and detect duplicates. This should however be done  without impairing the information flow in the EudraVigilance database  and the interpretation and  evaluation of safety data relevant for the protection of public health; given the high -level nature of the  information,  data element s such as patient's age, age group and gender should in principle be kept un - redacted/visible.   VI.C.6.2.2.9. Handling of l anguages   The ICH-E2B(R2)  (see GVP Annex IV) concept for the electronic reporting of ICSR s is based on the fact  that structured and coded information is used for data outputs of pharmacovigilance systems (e.g.  listings) and for signal detection. However, for scientific case assessment and signal evaluation, the  medical summary provided in the data element âCase narrative including clinical course, therapeutic  measures, outcome and additional relevant informationâ  (ICH-E2B(R2) B.5.1) is normally required  (see  VI.6.2.2.4 .).   Where suspected adver se reactions are reported by the primary source in narrative and textual  descriptions in an official language of the Union other than English, the original verbatim text and the  summary thereof in English shall be provided by the marketing authorisation holder40. Member States  may report case narratives in their official language (s). For  those reports, case translations shall  be  provided when requested by the Agency or other Member States for the evaluation of potential signals.   For suspected adverse reactio ns originating outside the EU, English shall be used in the ICSR  [IR 28  (4)].   Additional documents held by the sender, which may be only available in a local language, should only  be translated if requested by the receiver.   VI.C.6.2.2.10. Nullification of cases   In line with ICH-E2B(R2)  (see GVP Annex IV ), the nullification of individual cases should be used to  indicate that a previously transmitted report should be considered completely void (nullified), for  example when the whole case was found to be erro neous or in case of duplicate reports. It is essential  to use the same case report number s previously submitted in the data element  âSenderâs (case) safety                                                   40 In practice, the original verbatim text reported by the primary source in an official language of the Union other than  English should be included in the ICSR, if it is requested by the Member State where the reaction oc curred or by the  Agency.    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 41/90     report unique identifierâ  (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.0.1)  and in the data element  âWorldwide unique case  identification numberâ  (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.10) .   A nullified case is one that should no longer be considered for scientific evaluation.  The process of the  nullification of a case is by means of a notification by the sender to the receiver that this is no longer a  valid case. However, the case should be re tained in the senderâs pharmacovigilance database  for  auditing purposes .   The principles to be considered when nullifying a case are detailed in VI. Appendix  5.  VI.C.6.2.3. Special situations   VI.C.6.2.3.1. Use of a medicinal product during pregnancy or breastfeeding   General re commendations  are provided in VI.B.6.1..  With regard to the electronic reporting of parent -child/foetus  cases, the following should be adhered  to:  â¢ In the situation  where a foetus or nursing infant is exposed to one or several medicinal products  through the parent and experiences one or more suspected  adverse reactions (other than early  spontaneous abortion/f oetal demise) , information on both the parent and the child/foetus should  be provided in the same report. T hese cases are refe rred to as parent -child/foetus  reports.  The  information provided in the section âPatients characteristicsâ (ICH -E2B(R2) B.1) appli es only to the  child/foetus. The characteristics concerning the parent (mother or father), who was the source of exposure to the suspect medicinal product should be provided in the data element âFor a parent - child/fetus report, information concerning the p arentâ ( ICH-E2B(R2) B.1.10). If both parents are  the source of the suspect drug(s) then the case should reflect the motherâs information in the data element âFor a parent -child/fetus report, information concerning the parentâ (ICH E2B(R2) B.1.10).  The data  element âCase narrative including clinical course, therapeutic measures, outcome and  additi onal relevant informationâ (ICH -E2B(R2) B.5.1) should describe the entire case, including the  fatherâs information.   â¢ If both the parent and the child/foetus experien ce suspected adverse reactions, two separate  reports, i.e. one for the parent (mother or father)  and one for the child/foetus, should be created  but they should be linked by using the data element âIdentification number of the report which is  linked to this reportâ ( ICH-E2B(R2) A.1.12) in each report.   â¢ If there has been no rea ction affecting the child , the parent -child/foetus report does not apply; i.e.  the section âPatients characteristicsâ  (ICH-E2B(R2)  B.1) applies only to the parent (mother or  father) who  experienced the suspected adverse reaction.   â¢ For those cases describing miscarriage or early spontaneous abortion, only a parent report is  applicable, i.e. the section âPatients characteristicsâ (ICH -E2B(R2)  B.1) apply to the mother.  However, if the suspec t medicinal product was taken by the father , the data element âAddit ional  information on drugâ (ICH -E2B(R2)  B.4.k.1 9) should specify  that the medication was taken by the  father.   VI.C.6.2.3.2. Suspected adverse reaction  reports published in the scientific literature   EU requirements  in relation to the monitoring of suspected drug reactions  reported  in the scientific and  medical  literature are provided in VI.C.2.2.3 ..

VI.C.6.2.3.3. Suspected adverse reactions related to overdose, abuse, off -label use, misuse ,  medication error  or occupational exposure   General principles are provided in VI.B.6.3 ..  If a case of  overdose, abuse, off- label use, misuse , medication error  or occupational exposure  is  reported with clinical consequences, the MedDRA Lowest  Level Term code, corresponding to the term  closest to the description of the reported overdose, abuse,  off-label use,  misuse , medication error  or  occupational exposure  should be added to the observed suspected adverse reaction(s) in the data  element âReaction/event in MedDRA termin ology (Lowest Level Term)â (ICH -E2B(R2) B. 2.i.1), in line  with recommendations included in the latest version of the ICH-Endorsed Guide for MedDRA Users  'MedDRA Term Selection: Points to Consider ' (see GVP Annex IV ).  VI.C.6.2.3. 4. Lack of therapeutic efficacy   General principles  are provided in VI.B.6.4..  If the primary source suspects a lack of therapeutic efficacy, the MedDRA Lowe st Level Term code,  corresponding to the term closest to the description of the reported lack of therapeutic efficacy, should  be provided in the data element âReaction/event in MedDRA terminology (Lowest Level Term)â (ICH - E2B(R2) B.2.i.1 ), in line with recommendations included in the latest version of the ICH-Endorsed  Guide for MedDRA Users 'MedDRA Term Selection: Points to Consider ' (see GVP Annex IV) .   Unless aggravation of the medical condition occurs, the indication for which the suspected  medicinal  product was administered should not be included  in the data element âReaction/event in MedDRA  terminology (Lowest Level Term) .  The same reporting modalities as for serious ICSRs ( see VI.C.4 .) should be applied for those cases  related to classes of medicinal products where , as described in VI.B.6.4 ., reports of lack of therapeutic  efficacy should be reported within a 15 -day time frame . If no seriousness criterion  is available , it is  acceptable to submit the ICSR within 15  days as non -serious .                                                   41 The Vancouver recommendations are also available on the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors website  http://www.icmje.org .

Quality defect   Where a report o f suspected adverse reaction s is associated with a suspected or confirmed quality  defect of a  medicinal product, the MedDRA Lowest  Level Term code of the term corresponding most  closely to the product quality issue , should be added to  the observed suspecte d adverse reaction (s) in  the data element âReaction/event in MedDRA terminology (Lowest Level Term)â (ICH -E2B(R2) B.2.i.1 ).   b. Falsified medicinal products   Where a  report of  suspected adverse reaction s is associated with a suspected or confirmed falsified42  ingredient , active substance  or medicinal product , the MedDRA Lowe st Level Term code of the term  corresponding most closely to the reported information should be added to the observed suspected  adverse reaction (s) in the data element âReaction/event in M edDRA termin ology (Lowest Level Term)â  (ICH-E2B(R2) B.2.i.1 ). Information on the suspected medicinal product , active substance (s) or  excipient(s) should be provided in the data elements âProprietary medicinal product nameâ (ICH - E2B(R2) B.4.k.2.1) and/or âA ctive substance name(s)â  (ICH-E2B(R2) B.4.k.2.2 ) as reported by the  primary source .  VI.C.6.2.3.6. Suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent   EU requirements  are provided in VI.C.2.2.5 ..   The coding of a suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product in the  data  element  'Reaction/event in MedDRA terminology (Lowest Level Term)' (ICH -E2B(R2) B.2.i.1 ) should  be performed in line with the latest version of the ICH-Endorsed Guide for MedDRA Users 'MedDRA  Term Selection: Points to Consider ' (see GVP Annex IV ).  In addition, if the infectious agent is specified, the MedDRA Lowest  Level Term code corresponding to  the infectious agent should also be included  in the data element âReaction/event in MedDRA  termino logy (Lowest Level Term)â (ICH -E2B(R2) B.2.i.1 ).   VI.C.6.2.3.7. Report s of suspected adverse reactions originating from organised data  collection systems  and other systems   General safety reporting requirements in the EU for post- authorisation studies are provided in VI.C.1 .  and VI.C.2.2.2 .. Individual case safety reports originating from those  studies shall contain information  on study type, study name and the sponsorâs study number or study registration number [IR Art 28  (3)(c)].  This should be provided in ICH E2B(R2) section A.2.3 âStudy identi ficationâ.   Safety reporting requirements regarding patient support programmes or market research programmes  are provided in VI.C.2.2.11 ..  The following reporting rules should be applied based on (i) the type of data collection system and (ii) whether the suspected medicinal product is part of the scope of the data collection system.    1. For cases of  suspected  adverse reactions (i) in relation to those  adverse events for which the  protocol of non -interventional post -authorisation studies does not provide differently and requires                                                   42 As presented in EU legislation  (Directive 2011/62/EU ).

For suspected adverse reactions (i) in relation to those adverse  events for which the protocol of  non-interventional post- authorisation studies provides differently and does not require their  systematic collection  (see VI.C.1.2.1. ) or (ii)  originating  from compassi onate use or named patient  use conducted in Member States where the active collection  of adverse events occurring in these  programmes is not required  (see VI.C.1.2.2. ):   â¢ the report should be considered a s spontaneous repor t; as such it conveys the suspicion of the  primary source;  â¢ the ICH E2B(R2) data element A.1.4 'Type of report' should be populated with the value  'Spontaneous'.    3. For clinical trial conducted in accor dance with Directive 2001/20/EC and where the adverse reaction  is only suspected to be related to a non-investigational medicinal product (or another medicinal  product which  is not subject to the scope of the clinical trial)  and there is no interaction with the  investigational medicinal produc t:  â¢ the report should be considered as spontaneous repor t; as such it conveys the suspicion of the  primary source;  â¢ the ICH E2B(R2) data element A.1.4 'Type of report' should be populated with the value  'Spontaneous'.   All ICSRs  which are reportable to the E udraVigilance database  and which originate  from post- authorisation studies  which do not fall under the scope of the clini cal trials Directive 2001/20/EC,  should be submitted to EVPM (see VI.C.6.2.1 .). The same applies to  cases of  adverse reactions  originating in clinical trials if they are not suspected to be related to the investigational medicinal product.     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practice s (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 45/90     VI.C.6.2.3.8. Receipt  of missing minimum information   When missing minimum information ( see VI.B.2 .) has been obtained about a non -valid ICSR , the  following rules should be applied:   â¢ the data element âDate report was first received from sourceâ (ICH -E2B(R2) A.1.6) should contain  the date of receipt of the ini tial non -valid ICSR;   â¢ the data element âDate of receipt of the most recent information for this reportâ ( ICH-E2B(R2)   A.1.7) should contain the date when all the four elements of the minimum information required for  reporting have become available;   â¢ clarifica tion should be provided in the case narrative ( data element ICH -E2B(R2)  B.5.1) that some   of the four elements w ere missing in the initial report. ;  â¢ as for any reported cases, compliance monitoring is performed against  the data element âDate of  receipt of th e most recent information for this reportâ (ICH -E2B(R2) A.1.7) .  VI.C.6.2.4. Data quality of i ndividual case safety reports transmitted e lectronically  and  duplicate management   The EudraVigilance database should contain all cases of suspected adverse reactio ns that are  reportable according to Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC)  No 726/2004  to support  pharmacovigilance activities. This applies to all medicinal products au thorised in the EU independent  of  their authorisation procedure.   The EudraVigilance database  should also be based on the highest internationally recognised data  quality standards.   To achieve these objectives, all c ompetent authorities in Member States and marketing authorisation  holder s should adhere to:   â¢ the electronic reporting requirements as defined in EU legislation;   â¢ the concepts of data structuring, coding and reporting in line with the  EU legislation,  guidelines ,  standards and principles referred to in VI.C.6.2.2.1..  This is a pr e-requisite to maintain  a properly  functioning EudraVigilance database intended to fully  support the protection of public health .  The Agency shall , in collaboration with the stakeholder that submitted an ICSR to the EudraVigilance  database, be responsible for operating procedures that ensure the highest  quality and full integrity of  the information collected in the EudraVigilance database  [REG Art 24(3)]. This includes as well the  monitoring of use of the terminologies referred to in chapter IV of the Commi ssion Implementing  Regulation (EU) No 520/2012 [IR Art 25(3)].   Specific quality system procedures and processes shall be in place in order to ensure:    â¢ the submission of accurate and verifiable data on serious and non -serious suspected adverse  reactions to the Eudravigilance database within the 15 or 90- day time frame  [IR Art 11 (1) (c)];   â¢ the quality, integrity and completeness of the information submitted on the risks of medicinal  products, including processes to avoid duplicate submissions  [IR Art 11 (1) ( d)].  In this regard , marketing authorisation holders and competent authorities in Member States  should  have in place an audit  system , which ensure s the highest  quality of the ICSRs  transmitted  electronically to the EudraVigi lance database  within the correc t time frames, and which enables the   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 46/90     detection and management of duplicate ICSRs  in their system . Those transmitted ICSRs should be  complete, entire and undiminished in their structure, format and content.    High level business process maps and process descriptions in relation to the quality review of ICSRs  and the detection and management of duplicate ICSRs  are provided in VI. Appendix  6 and VI.  Appendix  7. Further guid ance on the detection of duplicate ICSRs is available in the G uideline on the  Detection and M anagement of D uplicate Individual Cases and I ndividual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs)  (EMA/13432/2009 ).  A review  of the ICSRs quality , integrity  and compliance with the reporting time frames  will be  performed by the Agency at regular intervals for all organisations reporting  to the EudraVigilance  database. Feedback from these reviews will be provided to those organisations.   VI.C.6.2.5. Electronic re-transmission of ICSRs  between multiple senders and r eceivers   The electronic re -transmission of cases refers to the electronic exchange  of ICSRs b etween multiple  senders and receivers, for example  where in case of contractual agreement, a third country ICSR is  first reported by a marketing authorisation holder  outside the EU to another marketing authorisation  holder in the EU  and from there  to the A gency.  This applies as well for the interim arrangements  period, where based  on the reporting requirements detailed in VI.C.4.1 ., ICSRs originating in the EU  are submitted by marketing authorisation holders to the competent authorities in the Member State  where the reaction occurred and then re -transmitted to the EudraVigilance database .   During this re -transmission process, information on the case should not in principle be omitted or  changed if no new information on the case is available to the re -transmitting sender.   Exceptions apply to the following  data elements  or sections :  â¢ âSenderâs (case) safety report unique identifierâ ( ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.0.1);   â¢ âDate of this transmissionâ ( ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.3);   â¢ âDate report w as first received from sourceâ (ICH -E2B(R2)  A.1.6) , for initial reports;   â¢ âDate of receipt of the most recent information for this reportâ ( ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.7);   â¢ âInformation on sender and receiver of case safety reportâ  (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.3);  â¢ âRelatedness of dru g to reaction(s)/event(s)â  (ICH-E2B(R2)  B.4.k.18) ;  â¢ âSender's diagnosis/syndrome and/or reclassification of reaction/event â (ICH-E2B(R2)  B.5.3);   â¢ âSenderâs comments â (ICH-E2B(R2)  B.5.4).   In the interest of improving data quality, in case of errors or inconsistencies in the report, the re - transmitters should go back to the originator of the report to correct the case accordingly. However, if  this cannot be done within normal reporting time frame, the re -transmitter can correct information that  has been incorre ctly structured.   In addition, any electronic data interchange  partner should adhere to the ICH -E2B(R2)  rules regarding  the provision of follow -up information,  whereby  the âWorldwide unique case identification numberâ  (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.10) should be maintain ed in accordance with the ICH-E2B(R2)  guideline  (see GVP  Annex IV ). Non -adherence to these administrative requirements endangers the electronic case  manage ment and  leads to the potential for unnecessary duplication of reports in the receiverâs  database .

Electronic reporting through c ompanyâs headquarters   If a pharmaceutical company decides to centralise the electronic r eporting of ICSRs (e.g. by reporting  through the companyâs g lobal or EU  headquarter), the following should be taken into account:   â¢ the central  reporting arrangement should be clearly specified in the marketing authorisation  holder âs pharmacovigilance system  master file  and in the interna l standard operating procedures;   â¢ the companyâs headquarter  designated for reporting the ICSRs should be  registered with  EudraVigilance;   â¢ the same principles may be applied for reporting ICSRs from the competent authorities in Member  States to the marketing authorisation holder s during the interim arrangement s period,  that is  the  competent a uthorities in Member States report electronically to the companyâs headquarter  instead  of to the local affiliate s.  VI.C.6.3. Electronic subm ission of information on medicinal products   To support the objectives of Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the provisions   provided in second sub -paragraph of Article 57(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, regarding the  electronic submiss ion and update of information on medicinal products for human use authorised or  registered in the EU , shall be followed by marketing authorisation holders. In this aspect marketing  authorisation holders shall apply the internationally agreed formats and te rminologies described in  chapter IV of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012. Recommendations  related  to the electronic submission of information on medicines  are provided on the Agencyâs website43.                                                   43 See EMA documents for electronic submission of information on medicines :  http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/document_listing/document_listing_000336.jsp&murl=m enus/regulations/regulation s.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac0580410138&jsenabled=true    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 48/90     VI.

Appendix 2 Detailed guida nce on the monitoring of  scientific literature   VI.App2.1. When to start and stop searching in the scientific  literature   EU specific requirements, as regards the monitoring of scientific and medical literature are provided in  VI.C.2.2.3 ..  In addition to the reporting of serious and non -serious ICSRs or their presentation in periodic safety  update reports , the marketing authorisation holder  has an obligation to re view the world wide  experience with medicinal product in the period between the submission of the marketing authorisation  application and the granting of the marketing authorisation.  The worldwide experience includes   published scientific and medical literature. For the period between submission and granting o f a  marketing authorisation, literature searching should be conducted to identify published articles that  provide information that could impact on the risk -benefit assessment of the product under evaluation .  For the purpose of the preparation of periodic s afety update report s (see Module VII ) and the  notification of e merging safety issues (see VI.C.2.2.6 .), the requirement for literature searching is not  dependent on a product being marketed. Literature searches should be conducted for all products with a marketing authorisation, irrespective of commercial status. It would therefore be expected that  literature searching would start on submission of a marketing authorisation application and continue  while the autho risation is active.   VI.App2.2. Where to look   Articles relevant to the safety of medicinal products are usually published in well- recognised scientific  and medical journals, however , new and important information may be first presented at international  symp osia or in local journals. Although the most well- known databases (e.g. Medline) cover the  majority of scientific and medical journals, the most relevant publications may be collated elsewhere in  very specialised medical fields, for certain types of produc t (e.g. herbal medicinal products) or where  safety concerns are subject to non -clinical research. A marketing authorisation holder  should establish  the most relevant source of published literature for each product.   Medline, Embase and Excerpta Medica are often used for the purpose of identifying  ICSRs. These  databases have broad medical subject coverage.  Other recognised appropriate systems may be used.   The database providers can advise on the sources of records, the currency of the data, and the nature  of database inclusions. It is best practice to have selected one or more databases appropriate to a  specific product. For example, in risk -benefit assessment, safety issues arising during non -clinical  safety studies may necessitate regular review of a database that has a less clinical focus and includes  more laboratory -based publications.   Relevant published abstracts from meetings and draft manuscripts should be reviewed for reportable  ICSRs  and for inclusion in periodic safety update report s. Although it is  not a requirement for  marketing authorisation holder s to attend all such meetings, if there are company personnel at such a  meeting, or it is sponsored by a marketing authorisation holder , it is expected that articles of relevance  would be available to th e marketing authorisation holder 's pharmacovigilance system. In addition,  literature that is produced or sponsored by a marketing authorisation holder  should be reviewed, so  that any reportable ICSRs can be reported as required in advance of publication.   If ICSRs are brought to the attention of a marketing authorisation holder  from this source, they should  be processed in the same way as ICSRs found on searching a database or reviewing a journal.   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 52/90     Abstracts from major scientific meetings are indexed and available in some databases, but posters and  communications are rarely available from this source.   VI.App2.3. Database Searches   A search is more than a collection of terms used to interrogate a database. Decisions about the database selection, approach to re cords retrieval, term or text selection and the application of limits  need to be relevant to the purpose of the search. For searches in pharmacovigilance, some of the  considerations for database searching are described below.   VI.App2.3.1. Precision and rec all  Medical and scientific databases are a collection of records relating to a set of publications. For any  given record, each database has a structure that facilitates the organisation of records and searching by various means, from simple text to complex  indexing terms with associated subheadings. Search  terms (text or indexed) can be linked using Boolean operators and proximity codes to combine concepts, increasing or decreasing the specificity of a search. In addition, limits to the output can be set. W hen searching, the application of search terms means that the output is less than the entire  database of the records held. The success of a search can be measured according to precision and recall (also called sensitivity). Recall is the proportion of records retrieved ("hits") when considering  the total number of relevant records that are present in the database. Precision is the proportion of  "hits" that are relevant when considering the number of records that were retrieved. In general, the  higher recall  searches would result in low precision.   VI.App2.3.2 . Search construction   Databases vary in structure, lag time in indexing and indexing policy for new terms. While some  database providers give information about the history of a particular indexing term or the application of synonyms, other databases are less sophisticated. In addition, author abstracts are not always  consistent in the choice of words relating to pharmacovigilance concepts or medicinal products/active  substances names.   When constructing a search for pharmacovigilance, the highest recall for a search would be to enter  the medicinal product  name  and active substance  name  (in all their  variants) only. In practice,  additional indexing terms and text are added to increase precision and to reduce the search result to  return records that are of relevance to pharmacovigilance. There is a balance to be achieved. It is, therefore, expected that complicated searches are accompanied by initial testing to check that relevant  records are not omitted , howe ver, there is no defined acceptable loss of recall when searching for  pharmacovigilance purposes. Term selection should be relevant to the database used and the subject  of the search.   VI.App2.3.3 . Selection of product terms   Searches should be performed to find records for active substance s and not for brand names only. This  can also include excipients or adjuvants  that may have a pharmacological effect. When choosing  search terms for medicinal product s, there are a number of considerations.   â¢ Is the active su bstance  an indexed term?   â¢ What spellings might be used by authors (particularly if the active substance  is not indexed)?    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 53/90     â¢ What alternative names might apply (numbers or codes used for products newly developed,  chemical names, brand names, active metabolites)?   â¢ Is it medically relevant to search only for a particular salt or specific  compound for an active  substance ?  During searches for ICSRs, it may be possible to construct a search that excludes records for  pharmaceutical forms or routes of administration dif ferent t o that of the subject product,  however,  restrictions should allow for the inclusion of articles where this is not specified. Search construction should also allow for the retrieval of overdose, medication error, abuse , misuse , off-label use  or  occupational exposure  information, which could be poorly indexed. Searches should also not routinely  exclude records of unbranded products or records for other company brands.   VI.App2.3.4 . Selection of search terms   As described previously, there is no acceptable loss of recall when searching published literature for  pharmacovigilance. The use of search terms (free text or use of indexing) to construct more precise  searches may assist in managing the output. Deficiencies that have been found frequently during  Competent Authority inspections include:   â¢ the omission of outcome terms,  for example "death" as an outcome may be the only indexed term  in a case of sudden  death;   â¢ the omission of pregnancy terms to find adverse outcomes in pregnancy for ICSR reporting;   â¢ the om ission of terms to include special types of reports  which needs to be addressed as well in  periodic safety update reports , for example,   â Reports of  asymptomatic overdose , medication error , off-label use, misuse, abuse,  occupational exposure ;   â Reports of  uneventful pregnancy .  VI.App2.3.5 . Limits to a search   Some databases apply indexing that allows the application of limits to a search, for example by subject  age, sex, publication type. The limits applied to a search are not always shown in the "search strat egy"  or search string.   If limits are applied, they should be relevant to the purpose of the search. When searching a worldwide  scientific and medical literature database, titles and abstracts are usually in English language. The use  of limits that reduce the search result to only those published in the English language is generally not  acceptable. Limits applied to patient types, or other aspects of an article, for example human, would need to be justified in the context of the purpose of a search.   Limits c an be applied to produce results for date ranges,  for example, weekly searches can be obtained  by specifying the start and end date for the records to be retrieved. Care should be taken to ensure that the search is incl usive for an entire time period,  for example, records that may have been added  later in the day for the day of the search should be covered in the next search period. The search  should also retrieve all records added in that period, and not just those initially entered or published  during the  specified period (so that records that have been updated or retrospectively added are  retrieved). This should be checked with the database provider if it is not clear.   Although one of the purposes of searching is to identify ICSRs for reporting, the use of publication type  limits is not robust. ICSRs may be presented within review or study publications, and such records may   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 54/90     not be indexed as "case- reports", resulting in their omission for preparation of periodic safety update  reports from search results li mited by publication type.   VI.App2.4. Record keeping   Records of literature searches  should be maintained in accordance with  the requirements described in  [IR Art 12]. Marketing authorisation holder s should  demonstrate due diligence in searching published  scientific and medical literature . It is always good practice to retain a record of the search construction,  the database used and the date the search was run. In addition, it may be useful to retain results of  the search for an appropriate period of time, particularly in the event of zero results. If decision  making is documented on the results, it is particularly important to retain this information.   VI.App2.5. Outputs   Databases can show search results in different ways, for example , titles only or title a nd abstract with  or without indexing terms. Some publications are of obvious relevance at first glance, whereas others  may be more difficult to identify. Consistent with the requirement to provide the full citation for an  article and to identify relevant p ublications, the title, citation and abstract (if available) should always  be retrieved and reviewed.   VI.App2.6. Review and selection of articles   It is recognised that literature search results are a surrogate for the actual article. Therefore, it is  expec ted that the person reviewing the results of a search is trained  to identify the articles of  relevance. This may be an information professional trained in pharmacovigilance or a  pharmacovigilance professional with knowledge of the database used. Recorded c onfirmation that the  search results have been reviewed will assist in demonstrating that there is a systematic approach to collecting information about suspected adverse reactions from literature sources. It is recommended that quality control checks are p erformed on a sample of literature reviews / selection of articles to  check the primary reviewer is identifying the relevant articles.   A common issue in selecting relevant articles from the results of a search is that often this process is conducted for th e purposes of identification of ICSRs only. Whereas the review should also be used as  the basis for collating articles for the periodic safety update report  production, therefore relevant  studies with no ICSRs should also be identified, as well as those re ports of events  that do not qualify  for reporting.   Outputs from searches may contain enough information to be a valid ICSR, in which case the article should be ordered. All articles for search results that are likely to be relevant to pharmacovigilance  requirements should be obtained, as they may contain valid ICSRs or relevant safety information . The  urgency with which this occurs should be proportionate  to the content of the material reviewed and the  resulting requirement for action as applicable for  the marketing authorisation holder .   Articles can be excluded from reporting by the marketing authorisation holder  if another company's  branded medicinal product is the suspect ed medicinal product. In the absence of a specified medicinal  product source and/or invented name, ownership of the medicinal product should be assumed for  articles about an active substance. Alternative reasons for  the exclusion of a published article for  the  reporting of ICSRs are detailed in VI.C.2.2.3 ..   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 55/90     VI.App2.7. Day zero   As described in VI.B.7 ., day zero is the date on which an organisation becomes aware of a publication  containing the minimum information for a n ICSR to be  reportable. Awareness o f a publication includes  any personnel of that organisation, or third parties with contractual arrangements with the  organisation. It is sometimes possible to identify the date on which a record was available on a  database, although with weekly literature searching, day zero for a reportable adverse reaction present  in an abstract is taken to be the date on which the search was conducted. For articles that have been  ordered as a result of literature search results, day zero is the date when the minimum info rmation for  an ICSR to be valid is available . Organisations should take appropriate measures to obtain articles  promptly in order to confirm the validity of a case.   VI.App2.8. Duplicates   Consistent with the requirements for reporting ICSRs, literature case s should be checked to prevent  reporting of duplicates, and previously reported cases should be identified as such when reported. It is, therefore, expected that ICSRs are checked in the organisation database to identify literature articles  that have already been reported.   VI.App2.9. Contracting out l iterature search services   It is possible to use the services of another party to conduct searches of the published scientific and  medical literature. In this event, the responsibility for the performance of the  search and subsequent  reporting still remains. The transfer of a pharmacovigilance task or function should be detailed in a contract between the organisation and the service provider. The nature of third party arrangements for literature searching can ran ge from access to a particular database interface only (access to a  technology) to full literature searching, review and reporting (using the professional pharmacovigilance services of another organisation). It is recognised that more than one organisation  may share services  of a third party to conduct searches for generic active substance s. In this instance, each organisation  should satisfy itself that the search and service is appropriate to their needs  and obligations .   Where an organisation is dependent  on a particular service provider for literature searching, it is  expected that an assessment of the service(s) is undertaken to determine whether it meets the needs   and obligations of the organisation. In any case, the arrangement should be clearly docume nted.  The clock start for the reporting of ICSRs begins with awareness of the minimum information by either  the organisation or the  contractual partner (whichever  is the earliest). This also applies where a third  party provides a review or  a collate d repor t from the published scientific and medical literature, in  order to ensure that published literature cases are reported as required within the correct  time frames.  That is, day zero is the date the search was run if the minimum criteria are available in th e abstract  and not the date the information was supplied to the organisation.   VI.App2.10.  Electronic submission of copies of articles  published in the  scientific literature   Until standards for the electronic transmission of attachments (e.g. copies of lite rature articles) are  developed in the framework of ICH, the sender should follow the rules outlined below for the  submission of a copy of the literature article as detailed in VI.C.6.2.3.2 .:  1. Mailing address and format  of literature articles:    Guideline on goo d pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 56/90     Literature articles reportable to the Agency should be provided in PDF format and sent via e -mail to  the following e -mail address: EVLIT@ema.europa.eu .  In relation to copies of articles f rom the published scientific and medical literature, marketing  authorisation holders are recommended to consider potential copyright issues specifically as  regards the electronic transmission and handling of electronic copies in the frame of regulatory activities.   2. File name of literature articles sent in electronic format to the Agency:   The file name of a literature article sent in PDF format should match exactly the âWorld -Wide  Unique C ase Identification Numberâ (ICH -E2B(R2) A.1.10.1 or A.1.10.2 as applica ble) assigned to  the individual case, which is described in the article and which is reported in the E2B(R2) ICSR format.   If there is a follow -up article to the individual case published in the literature, the file name with  the World -Wide Unique Case Iden tification Number must be maintained but should include a  sequence number separated with a dash.   Examples:  â¢ Initial ICSR published in the literature: FR -ORGABC -23232321 (data element âWorld- Wide Unique  Case Identification Numberâ (ICH -E2B(R2) A.1.10.1));   â File name of the literature article: FR -ORGABC -23232321.pdf.   â¢ Follow -up information published in the literature in a separate article:   â ICSR: FR -ORGABC -23232321 (data element World- Wide Unique Case Identificatio n Number  remains unchanged (ICH -E2B(R2) A.1.10.1) );  â File name: FR -ORGABC -23232321- 1.pdf.   3. Reporting of cases reported in the scientific and medical literature referring to more than one  patient:   When the literature article refers to the description of more than one patient, the copy of the  literature article should be sent only once.   The file name of a literature article sent in PDF format should match exactly the âWorld -Wide  Unique Case Identific ation Numberâ (data element ICH -E2B(R2) A.1.10.1 or A.1.10.2 as applicable)  assigned to the first reportable in dividual case described in the article.   In addition, all ICSRs which relate to the same literature article should be cross referenced in the  data element âIdentification number of the report which is linked to this reportâ (ICH -E2B(R2)  A.1.12). The data el ement should be repeated as necessary to cross refer all related cases  (see  Table VI.2 .).

If the case has  been received from a n EU NCA, do not   retransmit it to EudraVigilance (EV).   MAH  2 Open case.  Open and create an individual case safety  report.  MAH  3 Is case from EEA ? Did the adverse reactions  occur in the EU?   If No, go to step 3.1 .  If Yes, got so step 5.  MAH  3.1 Is case serious?  If No, go to step 3.2 .  If Yes, got to step 4. MAH  3.2 End. The case is now stored in the MAHs  pharmacovigilance database. Normal  follow-up activities should continue   and if any follow-up is received,  return to step 1.  MAH  4 Send to EV & relevant NCAs.  Transmit the serious case electronically,  in ICH E2B(R2) format as an xml message  within the 15 -day time  frame  to EV and to  the relevant NCAs , where required. The  case goes to step 4.1 & step 6.  MAH  4.1 Receive in EV.  Receive the message in EV database from  MAH or NCA.  EMA  4.2 Technical Validation (EV  Business Rules).  Every message that is received in EV is  validated against the EudraVigilance  Business Rules and an Ack nowledgement  message (ACK) is created specifying  whether or not the message & the case(s)  therein are valid.   A valid message will have an ACK code  01. A non -valid message will have an ACK  code 02 (if a case contained therein is  non-valid) or 03 (if the mes sage itself is  not correctly formatted).  EMA  4.3 Store in EV.  Once the case has been validated, it is  stored in EV.  EMA  4.4 Send ACK.  The acknowledgement message created in  step 4.2 is transmitted to the case  sender, no later than 2 business days  following receipt of the case.   Go to step 16  for MAHs receiving the ACK.

Appendix 5 Nullification of cases   General pri nciples regarding the nullification of cases are provided in VI.C.6.2.2.10 . The following  recommendation s should also be applied :  â¢ The value in the data element âReport nullificationâ ( ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.13) should be set to âYesâ and  the nullification reason should be provided in the data element  âReason for nullificationâ  (ICH- EB(R2) A.1.13.1) . The nullification reason should be clear and concise to explain why this case is  no longer considered to be a valid r eport. For example a nullification reason stating, âthe report no  longer meets the reporting criteriaâ or âreport sent previously in errorâ are not detailed enough  explanations.   â¢ An individual case can only be nullified by the sending organisation.   â¢ Once an individual case has been nullified, the case cannot be reactivated.   â¢ If it becomes necessary to resubmit the case that has been previously nullified, a new âSenderâs  (case) safety report unique identifierâ ( ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.0.1) and âWorldwide unique case  identification numberâ ( ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.10) should be assigned.   â¢ Individual versions  (i.e. follow -up reports ) of a case  cannot be nullified, only the entire individual  case to which they refer.   Table VI.11.  Examples of scenarios for which ICSRs should be nullified   Ex. Scenario Action   1 An individual case has been identified as  a duplicate of another individual case  previously submitted.  One of the individual cases should be nullified. The  remaining valid case should be updated with any  additional relevant  information from the nullified  case.  2 A wrong âWorldwide unique c ase  identification numberâ (ICH -E2B(R2)  A.1.10) was accidentally used and does  not refer to an existing case.  The case with the wrong âWorldwide unique c ase  identification numberâ (ICH -E2B(R2) A.1.10) shou ld  be nullified.   A new case should be created with a correct  âWorldwide unique case identification numberâ.   3 On receipt of further information it is  confirmed that that the adverse reaction  occurred before the suspect drug(s) was  taken.  The case should b e nullified.   4 On receipt of further information on an  individual case, it is confirmed that the  patient d id not receive the suspect drug.  Minimum reporting criteria for  an ICSR  as outlined in VI.B.2  are no longe r met.  The case should be nullified.   5 On receipt of further information it is  confirmed by the same reporter that the  reported adverse reaction(s) did not  occur to the patient.  Minimum reporting The case should be nullified.    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 81/90     Ex. Scenario Action   criteria for  an ICSR as outlined in  VI.B.2 are no longer met.   6 On receipt of further information it is  confirmed that there was no valid patient  for the individual case. Minimum  reporting criteria for  an ICSR as outlined  in VI.B.2  are no longer met.  If it is not possible to obtain confirmation of the  patientâs existence, then the case should be nullified.   â¢ Individual cases that have been nullified should not be used for scientific evaluation , however , they  should remain in the database for auditing purposes.   â¢ In addition, in case of duplicate reports where one report needs to be nullified, the update of the  remaining case should be performed in the form of a follow -up report49. Information on the  identi fication of the nullified case(s) should be provided in the data element âSource(s) of the case  identifier (e.g. name of the company, name of regulatory agency)â ( ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.11.1 ) and in  the data element âCase identifier(s)â ( ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.11.2) .  Table VI.12.  Examples of scenarios for which ICSRs should NOT  be nullified   Ex. Scenario  Action   7 A wrong âWorldwide unique case  identification numberâ ( ICH E2B(R2)   A.1.10) was accidentally used. This  wrong ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.10 âWorldwide  unique case identification number â  referred to an existing case.  The report with the wrong âWorldwide unique case  identification numberâ ( ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.10) should  not be nullified.   A follow -up report should be submitted to correct  the information previously submitted.   A new ICSR should be created and submitted with  the correct âWorldwide unique case identification  numberâ.   8 On receipt of further information on an  individual case, it is confirmed that the  patient did not receive the marketing  authorisation holder âs suspect drug.  However , the patient received other  suspect drugs and the minimum  reporting criteria for an ICSR are still  met. The case should not be nullified.   9 On receipt of further information the  reporter has confirmed that the reported  adverse reaction is no longer consi dered  to be related to the suspect medicinal  product (s). The case should not be nullified.   A follow -up report should be submitted within the  appropriate time frame with the updated information  on the case.                                                    49 As presented in the Guideline on the Detection and Management of Duplicate Individual Cases and Individual Case Safety  Reports (ICSRs) , EMA/13432/2009 .   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 82/90     Ex. Scenario  Action   10 Change of the individual case from  serious to non- serious (downgrading).  The case should not be nullified.   A follow -up report should be submitted with the data  element  âSeriousnessâ (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.5.1)  populated with the value  âNoâ without selection of a  value for the data element  âSeriousness crit eriaâ  (ICH-E2B(R2) A.1.5.2) .  The data element  âDoes this case fulfil the local  criteria for an expedited report?â ( ICH-E2B(R2)  field  A.1.9) should remain populated with the value  âYesâ.  11 The primary source country has  changed, which has an impact on the   ICH-E2B(R2)  convention regarding the  creation of the âWorldwide unique case  identification numberâ  (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.10) . The case should not be nullified.   The âSenderâs (case) safety report unique identifierâ  (ICH-E2B(R2) A.1.0.1) can be updated on the ba sis  of the new primary source country code. However,  the âWorldwide unique case identification numberâ  (ICH-E2B(R2) A.1.10) should remain unchanged.   If, for some technical reason, the senderâs local  system is not fully ICH -E2B(R2)  compliant and  cannot follow this policy, then the sender should  nullify the original case. A new case should be  created with a new âWorldwide unique case  identification numberâ (ICH -E2B(R2) A.1.10)  reflecting the changed primary source country code.  The âWorldwide unique case iden tification numberâ  (ICH-E2B(R2) A.1.10) of the case that was nullified  should be reflected in the data elements  âOther case  identifiers in previous transmissions â (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.11) .  12 The suspected medicinal product  belongs  to another marketing author isation  holder  (e.g. a product with the same  active substance but marketed under a  different invented name).  The case should not be nullified.   It is recommended that the initial sender informs the  other marketing authorisation holder  about this case  (inclu ding the âWorldwide unique case identification  numberâ (ICH-E2B(R2) A.1.10) used). The original  organisation should also submit a follow -up report to  provide this new information.   The other concerned marketing authorisation holder   should create a new case and specify the reference  case number and the name of the initial sending  marketing authorisation holder  in the data elements   âSource(s) of the case identifier (e.g. name of the  company name of regulatory agency)â (ICH -E2B(R2)  A.1.11.1) and âCase identifier(s)â (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.11.2) . This will allow grouping  the cases in the  EudraVigilance database.

Scenario  Action   13 The suspected medicinal product taken  does not belong to the marketing  authorisation holder  (same active  substance, the invented name is  unknown and the re port originates from  a country, where the marketing  authorisation holder  has no marketing  authorisation for the medicinal product in  question).  The case should not be nullified.   The marketing authorisation holder  should submit a  follow -up report with this information within the  appropriate time frame.   14 The case is mistakenly reported by the  marketing authorisation holder  A  although the marketing authorisation  holder  B as co -marketer is responsible  for reporting the case.  The case should not be nullified.   An explanation should be sent by the marketing  authorisation holder  A to the co- marketer marketing  authorisation holder  B that the case has already  been reported. The marketing authorisation holder  B  should provide any additional information on the  case as a follow -up report with the same âWorldwide  unique case identification numberâ  (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.10) .

No. Step Description  Responsible  Organisation   1 Start.   Decide upon Sender to  evaluate . Select one of  the organisations that  has transmitted ICSRs to your  database.   Inputs into this decision can incl ude,  but need not be limited to findings  from previous assessments and  requests from pharmacovigilance  audits . PhV DB  holder   2 Sample ICSRs from Sender.  Take a sample of ICSRs that were  transmitted by the selected sender  QA  3 Check for data quality errors . Check the cases for data quality errors.   The cases should be assessed against  appropriate published standards and  similar documents, for example the  MedDRA  Term Selection Points to  Consider document.  QA  4 Write report and send to PhV  DB holder . The findings from the data quality  assessment should be collated into a  single report. These can include related  checks, such as 15 -day reporting  compliance, whether  error reports are  corrected and similar statistical  information.  QA  5 Errors found?  Were any errors found during the analysis  of the cases?   If No, go to step 5.1 .  If Yes go to steps 5.2, 5.3 & 6 . PhV DB  holder   5.1 End. If there were no errors found, the n  no further action needs to be taken.  The process can end until the next  time the sender is assessed.   The PhV DB  holder may choose to  share this information with the  assessed sender and their auditors  who may wish to factor this in to  determinations of wh ich sender to  assess.  PhV DB  holder   5.2 Highlight for PhV audit.  If the PhV DB holderâs organisation has an  audit department, any significant findings  should always be shared with them.  PhV DB holder    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 86/90     No. Step Description  Responsible  Organisation   5.2.1  Prioritise for Audit . The audit or inspections  department  should use the information provided to  them to feed into decisions about  prioritising organisations for audit or  inspection . PhV DB  holderâs  auditors   5.3 INPUT: Findings from  previous assessments . Any errors found (or even lack thereof)  should  be incorporated into decisions  about which senders to evaluate & should  also inform the performance of the  assessments (e.g. targeting particular  types of case) and the report  (documenting whether previously  identified issues have been addressed).  PhV DB  holder   6 Inform sender of findings . Inform the sender of the findings,  including requested remedial actions (e.g.  retransmitting certain cases) and time  frames for those actions  PhV DB holder   7 Request meeting?  The sender should have the option to  choose  to request a meeting to discuss  the findings and appropriate remedial  action and time frames.   If no meeting is requested, go to step 7.1.  If a meeting is requested go to step 8.  Sender   7.1 Address the findings &  retransmit any required cases.  Address all  findings, take necessary steps  to prevent recurrence of such findings &  retransmit any required cases.  Sender   7.2 End. Once all findings have been  addressed,  the necessary steps taken  to preve nt recurrence of such  findings and any required cases have  been retransmitted, the process can  end until the next time the sender is  assessed.  Sender   8 Have meeting . Upon request from one party, a meeting  should be held to discuss the findings of  quality assessments and appropriate  remedial and preventive actions to  ensure  that the cases in the database are correct  and shall be so in the future . PhV DB  holder &  Sender   9 End. Unless further action has been  specified (e.g. future meetings or  assessments), the process can end  until the next time the sender is  assessed . PhV DB  holder      Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 87/90     VI. Appendix 7 Duplicate detection and management of ICSRs   Figure VI.8.  Business process map -  Duplicate detection and management of ICSRs      Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 88/90     Table VI.14.  Process description -  Duplicate detection and management of ICSRs   No. Step Description  Responsible  organisation   1 Start.   Potential duplicate  detected . Potential duplicates have been  detected  by the PharmacoVigilance  DataB ase (PhV DB) holder   organisation  or the PhV DB holder  organisation is notified of potential  duplicates by a receiver of the cases . PhV DB  holder   2 Assessment . All potential duplicates need  assessment by the organisation  Duplicate Management Team (DMT)  to confirm or deny their duplicate  status.   Following assessment there are 4 possible  outcomes:   â¢ Not a Duplicate (go to step 2.1) ,  â¢ More Information N eeded (go to  step 2.2) ,  â¢ Duplicates From Different Sender  (go to step 2.3) ,  â¢ Duplicates From Same Sender (go  to step 2.4) .  The outcome of all assessments should be  recorded to avoid continually reassessing  the same case s when further  versions  arrive. These r ecorded outcomes can also  be used to refine the duplicate detection  methods during future development . DMT  2.1 Not a Duplicate: Mark as  not a duplicate . If the cases are assessed as not being  duplicates of one another, then mark both  cases as such.   Go to step 3 (End).  DMT  2.2 More information needed:  Log in tracking tool.  There should be some form of tool for  tracking when more information is  needed, when correspondence has been  sent, whether an answer was received  and, if so, when.  DMT  2.2.1 Write to Se nder. More information is required in order to  be able to make a definite assessment.   The sender (who transmitted the case(s)  in question to the PhVDB holderâs  organisation) should be contacted to  request specific information necessary to  confir m or deny duplication.   Personal data protection must remain  paramount, so unsecured communications  should not include sufficient data to PhV DB  holder    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 89/90     No. Step Description  Responsible  organisation   identify an individual.   2.2.2 Receive request, draft  and send response . Once a request  for more information has  been received, the Sender of the case  should respond promptly, either as a  follow -up version of the case or by  responding to the requester.   The DMT should then reassess the case  based on the new information (Go back to  step 2) . Sender   2.3 Duplicates Differe nt  Senders: Create or  nominate master . Once cases have been determined to be  duplicates of one another  and have been  transmitted  to the PhV DB holder by  different senders or reporters, then they  should be merged under a master case,  following the process d escribed in chapter  2.3 âManagement of duplicate casesâ of  the Guideline on the Detection and  Management of Duplicate Individual Cases  and Individual Case Safety Reports  (ICSRs) , EMA/13432/2009 . DMT  2.3.1 Deal with follow -ups. If any follow -ups arrive for any of the  cases, this information may require a  reassessment of the master case.   Reassess and, if necessary, amend the  maste r case as with any received follow - up information.   Go to step 3 (End) . DMT  2.4 Duplicates Same Sender:  Log in tracking tool . Once cases have been determined to be  duplicates of one another, and have been   transmitted to the PhV DB holder by the  same sender , then this decision and the  correspondence referred to in step 2.4.1  should be logged in the tracking tool  referred to in step 2.2 . DMT  2.4.1  Write to Sender . The sender organisation, as the source of  the duplicates, should be contacted in  accordance wit h chapter 2.3.3 of the  Guideline on the Detection and  Management of Duplicate Individual Cases  and Individual Case Safety Reports  (ICSRs), EMA/13432/2009 .  The sender should be asked to confirm or  deny duplication and take appropriate  steps  in accordance with chapter 2.3.1 of  the aforementioned Guideline.  PhV DB  holder   2.4.2  Receive request . Receive and log the communication Sender    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 1)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 1  (superseded version)  Page 90/90     No. Step Description  Responsible  organisation   containing information on suspected  duplicates in the Senderâs PhV DB.   2.4.3 Is it a duplicate?  Assess the potential duplicates. Are the  cases duplicates of one another?   If Yes, go to step 2.4.3.1.   If No, go to step 2.4.3.2 . Sender   2.4.3.1  Merge dupli cates. Merge the duplicates, taking into account  Flowchart 1 of c hapter 2.3.1.3 of the  Guideline on the Detection and  Management of Duplicate Individual Cases  and Individual Case Safety R eports  (ICSRs), EMA/13432/2009 . Sender   2.4.3.1.1  Send follow -up/nullification . For the cases that  are merged under the  master, send a nullification message to  the PhV DB  holder.   For the case  that is master , send the  updated case to the PhV DB holder  as  follow -up information. The merging &  transmission should be completed  promptly and in any case within 15 days  of the date of receipt of the information  from the PhV DB holder that the cases  were co nsidered to be possible duplicates.  This date should be treated as the date of  receipt of most recent information for  regulatory reporting purposes.  Sender   2.4.3.1.2  End. The duplicates have now been  removed from both the Senderâs  system and that of the P hV DB h older  and only the master should be  available for signal detection and  data quality analyses.   Unless follow-up information is  received, then no further steps need  be taken.  Sender   2.4.3.2  Draft and send a response . Reply to the PhV DB holder who sent the  communication informing that the cases  are not duplicates . Sender   2.4.3.2.1  Mark as âNot a  duplicateâ.  Upon receipt of confirmation from the  Sender organisation that the cases are  not duplicates, mark the cases as âNot a  duplicateâ & go to step 3 ( End). DMT  3 End. No further action is required for this  couple . DMT

Introduction   VI.A.1. Scope This Module of GVP addresses the legal requirements detailed in TitleTITLE  IX of Directive  2001/83/EC [DIR] and chapter Chapter  3 of TITLE  II of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  [REG] , which are  applicable to  competent authorities in Member States, marketing authorisation holde rs and the Agency   as regards the collection, data management and reporting submission of individual reports  of  suspected adverse reactions  (serious and non -serious)  associated with medicinal products for human  use authorised in the European Union ( EU).   Section VI.B. of this Module highlights the general principles , based on the pharmacovigilance  guidelines E2A, E2B  and E2D of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements  for Pharmaceutic als for Human Use (ICH)  (see GVP Annex IV ), in relation to the collection, recording  and submiss ion of individual reports of suspected adverse reactions associated with medicinal product s  for human use . The definitions and guidance  provided in Section VI.A. and the  EU specific  requirements presented in Section  VI.C. should be followed .   All applicable legal requirements  are referenced in the way explained in the GVP Introductory Cover  Note and are usually identifiable by the modal verb âshallâ. Guidance for the implementation of legal  requirements is provided using the modal verb âshouldâ.   The guidance provided in th is Module does not address the collection, management and submission  of  individual reports of events or patterns of use, which do not result in suspected adverse reactions  (e.g.  asymptomatic overdose, abuse, misuse  or medication error) and which are not re quired to be  submitted  as individual case safety reports (ICSRs) . This information may however need to be  collected and presented in periodic safety update reports for the interpretation of safety data or for the  benefit risk evaluation of medicinal produc ts. With regard to this , the guidance provided in GVP Module  VII applies.   Recommendations regarding the report ing of emerging safety issues or of suspected adverse reactions  occurring in special situations are also presented  in this Module . The requirements provided in  chapter sChapters  IV, V and IX of the  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012  [IR]  shall be applied in this Module.   The guidance provided in this Module does not address  the collection, management and reporting of  events or patterns of use, which do not result in suspected adverse reactions  (e.g. asymptomatic  overdose, abuse, off-label use , misuse  or medication error) or which do are not require require d to be  reported submitted  as individual case safety report  or as emerging safety issues. This information may  however need to be collected and presented in periodic safety update reports for th e interpretation of  safety data or for the benefit risk evaluation of medicinal products. In this aspect , the guidance  provided in  GVP Module VII  applies.   Section B of this Module highlights the general principles in relation to the collection, recording and  of  reports of suspected adverse reactions associated with medicinal product s for human use , which  are  applicable to competent authorities and marketing authorisation holders. The definitions and  recommendations provided in VI.A. should be followed.  EU requirements are presented in VI.C..   All applicable legal requirements  detailed in this Module  are referenced in the way explained in the GVP  Introductory Cover Note  and are usually identifiable by the modal verb âshallâ. Guidance for the  implementation of legal requirements is provid ed using the modal verb âshouldâ.

Definitions and tTerminology   The definitions provided  in Articleicle 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC  of Directive 2001/83/EC  shall be  applied  for the purpose of this  Module ; of particular relevance are those provided  in this Section . Some  general principles presented  in the ICH-E2A and ICH -E2D guidelines  (see GVP Ann ex IVGVP Annex IV )  should also be adhered to ; they  are included  as well in this Section (see GVP Annex I  for all definitions  applicable to GVP) .   VI.A. 1.1. Adverse  reaction , causality   VI.A.2. 1. Adverse reaction :   An adverse reaction  is aA response to a medicinal product which is noxious and unintended   [DIR Art  1 ]. This includes adverse reactions w hich arise from:(11)]. Adverse reactions may arise from use of  the product within or outside the terms of the marketing authorisation or from occupational exposure  [DIR Art 101(1)].  Use outside the marketing authorisation include s off-label use, overdose, misuse,  abuse and medication errors .    Causality: the use of a medicinal product  within the terms of the marketing authorisation ;  the use outside the terms of the marketing authorisation, including overdose, off-label use, misus e,  abuse and medication error s;  occupational exposure.   VI.A.2. 1.1. Causality   In accordance with ICH-E2A (see GVP Annex IV ), the definition of an adverse reaction implies at least  a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between a suspected medicinal product and an adverse  event1. (see GVP Annex I ). An adverse  reaction, in contrast to an adverse event, is characterised b y  the fact that a causal relationship between a medicinal product  and an occurrence is suspected. For  regulatory reporting purposes, as detailed in ICH -E2D (see GVP Annex IV ), if an event is  spontaneously reported, even if the relationship is unknown or unstated, it meets the definition of an  adverse reaction. Therefore all spontaneous reports notified by healthcare professionals2 or  consumers2 are considered suspected adverse reactions, since they convey the suspicions of the  primary source s3, unless the reporter s specifically st ate that they believe the event s to be unrelated  or  that a causal relati onship can be excluded .  VI.A. 21.12.2. Overdose , off-label use, misuse, abuse, occupational  exposure , medication error , falsified medicinal product   a. Overdose : This refers to the administration of a quant ity of a medicinal product given  per  administration or cumulatively , which is above the maximum  recommended dose according to the  authorised product information. Clinical  judgement should always be applied.   b. Off-label use : This relates  to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally used  for a  medical purpose  not in accordance with the  authorised  product information terms of the marketing  authorisation .                                                    1 An adverse event  is defined in ICH -E2D (see GVP Annex IV ) as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal r elationship with this treatment .  2 See VI.A.2.3.  for definition of primary source   3 See VI.A.1.4.  for definition of primary source .     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 9/225     c. Misuse : This refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately   used no t in accordance with the  authorise d product information terms of the marketing authorisation .   d. Abus e: This corresponds  to the persistent or sporadic , intentional excessive use of a medicinal  product, which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects  [DIR Art 1 ].(16)].  e. Occupational exposure : This refers  to the exposure to a medicinal product (as see  definition defined  in [DIR VI.A.1.3. Art 1]) ,(2)]), as a result of oneâs professional or non -professional  occupation.  It does n ot include the exposure to one of the ingredients during the manufacturing  process before the release  as finished product .   Medication error : This is an unintended failure in the drug treatment process that leads to, or has the  potential to lead to harm to  the patient4.  Falsified medicinal product : This relates to any medicinal product with a false representation of:   ï· its identity, including its packaging and labelling, its name or its composition as regards any of the  ingredients including excipients and th e strength of those ingredients;   ï· its source, including its manufacturer, its country of manufacturing, its country of origin or its  marketing authorisation holder; or   ï·  its history, including the records and documents relating to the distribution channels u sed.  This definition does not include unintentional quality defects and is without prejudice to infringements  of intellectual property rights [DIR Art 1 (33)].  VI.A. 21.23. Active substance, excipient,  Mmedicinal product , Aactive   substance, excipient   Active substance: Any substance or mixture of substances intended to be used in the manufacture of  a medicinal product and that, when used in its production, becomes an active ingredient of that  product intended to exert a pharmacological, immunological or metabo lic action with a view to  restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions or to make a medical diagnosis  [DIR Art  1(3a)].  Excipient: Any constituent of a medicinal product other than the active substance and the packaging  material  [DIR Art 1(3b)]; E.g. colouring matter, preservatives, adjuvant, stabilisers, thickeners,  emulsifiers, flavouring and aromatic substances  [DIR Annex I ].  Medicinal product : A medicinal product is characterised by any substance or combination of  substances ,  ï· presented as h aving properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings; or   ï· which may be used in , or administered to human beings either with a view to restoring, correcting  or modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or m etabolic  action, or to making a medical diagnosis  [DIR Art 1].(2)].  Active substance : An active substance corresponds to any substance or mixture of substances  intended to be used in the manufacture of a medicinal product and that, when used in its product ion,  becomes an active ingredient of that product intended to exert a pharmacological, immunological or                                                   4 From: Good practice gu ide on recording, coding, reporting and assessment of medication errors (EMA/762563/2014 );  EMA website: Home/ Human r egulatory/ Post -authorisation/ Pharmacovigilance/ Medication errors .

Excipient : An excipient corresponds to a ny constituent of a medicinal product other than the active  substance and the packaging material  [DIR Art 1(3b)].  In accordance with  Article 107 of Directive 2001/83/EC , the scope of this module Module  is not only  applicable to me dicinal products authorised in the EU but also to any such medicinal products  commercialised outside the EU by the same marketing authorisation holder ( see VI.C.2.2 .). Given that   a medicinal product is authorised with a defined composition,  all the  adverse reactions suspected to be  related to any of the active substance s being part of a medicinal product authorised in the EU should  be managed in accordance with the requirements presented in this module Module. This is valid  independently  of the strengths, pharmaceutical forms, routes of administration, presentations,  authorised  indications , or trade  names of the medicinal product.  For the definition of the name  and  strength of a medicinal product , refer to  Article 1(20) and  Article 1(22)  of Directive 2001/83/EC .     The guidance provided in this M odule also applies , subject to amendments where appropriate , to  medicinal products supplied in the context of compassionate use  (see VI.C.1.2.2 .) as defined in Article  83(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 ., subject to and without prejudice to applicable national law of  the EU Member States . As the case may be, this guidance may also apply  to named patient use as  defined under Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC .   For device s containing active substances , whether the y are authoris ed in the EU as medicinal product s  or CE marked as medical device s determine s which procedure should be followed for  the safety  reporting of suspected adverse  reactions and/or incident s. In this aspect , medicinal products follow the  requirements for pharmacovigilance provided in Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No  726/2004 , whereas medical devices follow the requirements  for medical device vigilance  in accordance  with Directive 90/385/EEC and Directive 93/42/EEC. As detailed in the Guidelines on a Medical Devices  Vigilance System5, a medical device incorporating a medicinal product or substance , where the action  of the medicinal produ ct or substance is a ncillary to that of the device, follow s the legal requirements  of Directive  90/385/EEC and Directive 93/42/EEC .  VI.A. 21.34. Primary source , healthcare professional and consumer   The In accordance with ICH -E2B, the primary source  of the i nformation on a suspected adverse  reaction (s) is the person who reports the facts . about an individual case safety report ICSR. Several  primary sources , such a s healthcare professional s and/or a consumer consumer s, may provide  information  on the same case . In this situation, all the primary sources â details , including the  qualifications,  should be provided  in the case report ICSR, with and the âPrimary source(s)â section  should be repeated as necessary  in line with ICH-E2B(R2) (see GVP Annex IV )6.VI.B.2 . for ICSRs  validation  based on the primary source identifiability  of reports ).   In accordance  with the ICH-E2D (see GVP Annex IV ),  ï· a healthcare professional is defined as a medically -qualified person such as a physician, dentist,  pharmacist, nurse  , coroner  or as otherwise  specified by local regulations;   ï· a consumer is defined as a person who is not a healthcare professional such as a patient, lawyer,  friend , relative of a patient  or carer .                                                   5 Ref.: MEDDEV 2.12 -1 rev 8  (Ref. Ares(2016)856772 - 18/02/2016)    6 See VI.C.6  as regards the electronic reporting of ICSRs  in the EU.

This data element  refers to the person who first reported the facts. I n case of multiple primary sources   from different countries , itthis data element  identif ies the country source offor the ICH-E2B data  element â worldwide unique case unique identification number â by defining  the country where the case  occurred .   Where the patient experienced a  suspected adverse  reaction in a nother  country  than the one of the  primary source , this information should be captured in the ICH -E2B data element âIdentification of the  Country Where the Reaction / Event Occurred â, e.g. a male patient  from Ireland is reporting  experienc ing an anaphylactic reaction with drug X while travelling in Spain , in this in stance the primary  source country is Ireland and the occurrence country is Spain . Guidance about  the automatic rerouting  of the ICSR to the competent authority of the EU Member State where the reaction occurred  is  provided in VI.C.4. .  VI.A. 1.35. Medical confirmation   A consumer  may provide m edical documentation s (e.g. laboratory or other test data)  provided by a  consumer  that support support s the occurrence of thea suspected adverse reaction , or and which  indicate indicates that an  identifiable healthcare professional  suspects a reasonable possibility of causal  relationship between  a medicinal product and the reported  adverse event reaction , are sufficient to  consider the spontaneous report as confirmed by a healthcare pr ofessional.   If a consumer initially reports more than one reaction and at least one receives medical confirmation,  the whole report should be documented as a spontaneous report confirmed by a healthcare  professional and be reported accordingly. . Similarly,  if a report ismay be  submitted notified by a  medically qualified patient, friend , relative or carer  of the patient  or care r. In these situation s, the case  should also be reported information is  considered as a spontaneous report medically  confirmed  by a  healthcare professional .  In the same way, where one or more suspected adverse reactions  initially reported by a consumer   isare subsequently confirmed by a healthcare professional professional or contains  medical  documentation that supports the occurrence of a suspected adverse reaction , the caseICSR should be  considered medically confirmed . It should be  updated  at case level  in line with ICH -E2B(R2), or at  adverse reaction  level in accordance with ICH -E2B(R3)  for each subsequently medically confirmed  suspected adverse reaction .  VI.A. 21.46. Seriousness   As described in  ICH-E2A (see GVP Annex IV ), a serious adverse reaction corresponds to  any untoward  medical  occurrence that at any dose results in deat h, is life -threatening, requires inpatient  hospitalisation or prolongation of  existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or  incap acity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .   The characteristics/consequences should  be considered at the time of the reaction  to determin e the  seriousness  of a case . For example, life -threatening refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk  of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have  caused death if more severe.                                                    7 ICH Implementation Guide for Electronic Transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) E2B(R3) Data Elem ents  and Message Specification  (Accessible at http://estri.ich.org/e2br3/index.htm )     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 12/225     Medical  judgement should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered as  serious  reactions . Some medi cal events may jeopardise the patient  or may require an intervention to  prevent one of the above characteristics/consequences. Such important medical events s hould be  considered as serious8. The EudraVigilance Expert Working Group has co -ordinated the deve lopment of  an important medical event (IME) terms list based on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA)  (see GVP Annex IV ). This IME list aims to facilitate the classification of suspected adverse  reactions , the analysis of aggregated data and the assessment of the individual case safety reports  (ICSRs ) in the frame work of the day-to-day pharmacovigilance activities . The IME list is intended for  guidance purposes only  and is available  on the Agency the EudraVigilance web site9 to stakeholders  who wish to use it for their pharmacovigilance activities . It is regularly updated in line with the  latest  version of MedDRA .  Where one or more serious suspected adverse reaction s are reported  in an ICSR , the information on  the seriousness sho uld be documented at case level in line with ICH -E2B(R2) or for each reported  suspected adverse reaction in accordance with ICH-E2B(R3) , depending on the ICH -E2B format used  for the ICSR electronic submission .  VI.A. 21.57. Individual case safety report (ICSR)   This refers to the format and content for the submission of an individual report  reporting of one or  several suspected adverse reactions in relation to a medicinal product that occur in a single patient at  a specific point of time . [IR Art 27] . A valid ICSR should  include at least one identifiable reporter, one  single  identifiable patient, at least one sus pect adverse reaction , and a t least one  suspect medicinal  product  (see VI.B.2.  for ICSRs validation) .   VI.A. 21.68 NnullfFlavor s  The NnullFflavors  are a collection of codes specifying why a valid value is not pr esent in an ICSR . They  are available with the ICH-E2B(R3) format and not  with ICH-E2B(R2) . Theyis refers to instances ,  where for example a proper value is applicable, but not known (e.g. age of the patient  is unknown:  code UNK ), or where the value is maske d i.e. information is available to a sender of an ICSR but it is  masked  because it  cannot be provided due to security, privacy or other  reasons (e.g. date of birth of  the patient  cannot be shared  due to local data protection laws : code MSK ). ICH-E2B(R3) ICSR uses the  nullFlavorNullflavo ur code sets from the HL7 Messaging Standard  primarily to classify the set of source  data situations that may give rise to a missing value.  For examples how a nullFlavorNullflavor s can be  used to code values in the ICSR, refer to chapter 3.3. 6. of the ICH Implementation Guide for Electronic  Transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) E2B(R3) Data Elements and Message  Specification , Version 5.01, 12 April 201310. Additional EU guidance on the use of the  nullFlavorNullflavor  in some specific situations is also provided in chapter I.C.3.7 . of the EU Individual  Case Safety Report (ICSR) Implementation Guide11.                                                    8 Examples are provided in section II.B of ICH -E2A (see GVP Annex IV ).  9 EMA website:  Home/Human regulatory/Post -authorisation/Pharmacovigilanc e/EudraVigilance/System overview   http://eudravigilance.ema.europa.eu/human/textforIME.asp .  10 Accessible at http://estri.ich.org/e2b r3/index.htm    11 Ref.

Structures and processes  Section B of this Module highlights the general principles in relation to the collection, recording and  reporting of reports of suspected adverse reactions associated with medicinal product s for human use,  which are applicable to competent authorities  and marketing authorisation holders. The definitions and  recommendations provided in VI.A. should be followed. EU requirements are presented in VI.C..   VI.B.1. Collection  of reports   Competent authorities  and marketing authorisation holders should take appropriate measures  in order   to collect  and collate all reports of suspected adverse reaction s associated with medicinal products for  human use originating from unsolicited or so licited sources .   For this purpose, a pharmacovigilance system should be developed to allow the acquisition of sufficient  information  for the scientific evaluation of those reports.   The system should be designed so that it helps to ensure that the collect ed reports are authentic,  legible, accurate, consistent, verifiable and as complete as possible for their clinical assessment.   All notifications that contain pharmacovigilance data should be recorded  and archived  in compliance  with the applicable data pro tection requirements  (see VI.C.6.2.2. 8VI.C.6.2.2.10 . for guidance on the  processing of personal data in the EU for EU requirements ).   The system should also be structured  in a way that allows for  reports of suspect ed adverse reactions to  be validated (see VI.B.2 . for ICSRs validation ) in a timely manner and exchanged  between competent  authorities  and marketing authorisation holders within the legal reporting  submission  time frame (s ee  VI.B.7.1 . for ICSRs  time frames  submission ).  In accordance with the ICH-E2D (see GVP Annex IV ), two types of safety reports are distinguished in  the post -authorisation phase ; : reports originating from unsolicited sources a nd those reported as  solicited .  VI.B.1.1. Unsolicited reports   VI.B.1.1.1. Spontaneous reports   A spontaneous report is an unsolicited communication by a healthcare professional , or consumer to a  competent authority , marketing authorisation holder  or other organi sation (e.g. Regional regional  Pharmacovigilance pharmacovig ilance Centrecentre , Poison poison Control control Centr ecentre ) that  describes one or more suspected adverse  reactions in a patient who was given one or more medicinal  products  and that . It does not derive from a study or any organi sed data collection systems where  adverse event s reporting is actively sought , as defined in VI.B.1.2 .. In this aspect With regard to this ,  the following situations should also be considered as spontaneous reports:   ï· Stimulated stimulated report ing that occur s consequent to  a direct healthcare professional   communication  (see Module XV), GVP Module XV ), publication in the press, questioning of  healthcare professionals by company representatives , communication  from patientsâ organisations  to their members , or class action lawsuit s should be considered spontaneous  reports .;   ï· Unsolicited unsoli cited consumer adverse reaction s reports should be handled as spontaneous  reports irrespective of any subsequent âmedical confirmation â. ;     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 14/225     ï· Rreports of suspected adverse reactions , which are not related to any organised data collection  systems  and (i) which  are notified through medical enquiry /product information  services or (ii)  which are consequent of the distribution of information  or education al materials ;   ï· unsolicited reports  of suspected adverse reactions collected from the internet or digital media  (see  VI.B.1.1.4.  for guidance on ICSRs management from the internet or digital media );  ï· an individual  cCases notified by different reporters , referring to the same patient and same  suspected adverse reaction , and a t least one notification is done in an unsolicited  manner spontaneously ;   ï· Rreports of suspected adverse reaction s originating from non-interventional post -authorisation  studies and related to specified  adverse events for which the protocol does not require atheir  systematic collection ( see VI.C.1.2.1. 1. for EU guidance on this type of non-interventional post- authorisation studies , and VI.6.2.3.7 Subsection 2  for EU guidance on the electronic submission of  these ICSRs );   ï·   ï· Rreports of suspected adverse reactions originating from compassionate use or named patient use  conducted in a countr yies where the active systematic  collection of adverse events occurring in  these programmes is not required ( see VI.C.1.2.2.  for EU guidance on compassionate use or  named patient use , and  VI.6.2.3.7 Subsection 2  for EU guidance on the elect ronic submission of  these ICSRs ).   The reporting  modalities for the submission of spontaneous reports of suspect ed adverse reactions  and  the applicable  time frames for spontaneous reports are described in VI.B.7. and VI.B.8..  VI.B.1.1.2. Literature reports   The scientific and medical literature medical literature  is a significant source of information for the  monitoring of the safety profile and of the risk-benefit balance of medicinal products , particularly in  relation to the detection of new safety signals or emerging safety issues . Marketing authorisation  holders are therefore expected to maintain awareness of possible publications through a systematic  literature review of widely used reference database s (e.g. Medline, Excerpta Medica or Embase) no less  frequently than once a week. The marketing authorisation holder should ensure that the literature  review includes the use of r eference databases  that contai n the largest reference of articles in relation  to the medicinal product properties12. In addition, marketing authorisation holder s should have  procedures in place to monitor  scientific and medical publications in local journals  in countries where  medicinal  product s have a marketing authoris ation, and to bring them to the attention of the company  safety department as appropriate.    Reports of suspected adverse reactions from the scientific and medical literature medical literature ,  including relevant published  abstracts from meetings and draft manuscripts, should be reviewed and  assessed by marketing authorisation holders  to identify and rec ord ICSRs  originating  from spontaneous  reports or non-interventional post-authorisation studies .   If multiple medicinal pr oducts are mentioned in the publication, only those which are identified by the  publication's author(s) as having at least a possible causal relationship  with the suspected adverse  reaction should be considered for literature review  by the concerned market ing authorisation holder (s).                                                    12 See VI. Appendix App.2. for the detailed guidance  on the monitoring of the medical and scientific literature.      Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 15/225     Valid ICSRs sh ould be reported submitted  according to in accordance with  the time frames and  modalities detailed in VI.B.7 . and VI.B.8 ..   One case should be created for each single  identifiable  patient  identifiable  based on in line with  the  characteristics provided in VI.B.2 .... Relevant medical information should be provided  recorded and the  first publication author (s) (or the corresponding  author , if designated ) should be considered as the  primary source (s) of information . as well as the primary source for regulatory purpos es in line with  ICH-E2B(R3) (see  VI.A.2.3. ). Details about t The co -authors should do not need to be  reflected documented   among as part of  the primary source s of information.   EU specific requirements , as regard sconcerning the  medicinal products active substances  and the  scientific and medi cal publications , which are not monitored by the Agency and for which valid ICSRs  shall be reported submitted  to the EudraVigilance database by marketing authorisation holders , are  provided in VI.C.2.2.3 .1.. Exclusion  criteria in relation to  the submission in the EU of ICSRs published  in the literature are also detailed in VI.C.2.2.3.2 ..  VI.B.1.1.3. Reports from other non-medical sources  (e.g. general  news or other media )  If a marketing authorisation holder becomes aware of a repor t of suspected adverse reaction s  originating  from a non -medical source , for example  the lay press or other media, it should be handled  managed  as a spontaneous report. Every attemp t should be made to follow -up the case to obtain the  minimum information that constitutes a valid ICSR. With regard to the submission of those ICSRs , Tthe  same reporting modalities and time frames  should be applied as for other spontaneous reports.   VI.B.1. 1.4. Information on suspected adverse reactions from the internet  or digital media   Marketing In line with ICH -E2D (see GVP Annex IV ), marketing  authorisation  holders  should regularly  screen  the internet or digital media13 under their management or responsi bility, for potential reports of  suspected  adverse reactions. In this With respect to this  aspect , a digital medi uma  is considered to be  company sponsored if it is owned, paid for and/or controlled by the marketing authorisation holder14.  The frequency of the screening should allow for potential valid ICSRs to be reported submitted  to the  competent authorities  within the appropriate  regulatory  reporting  submission  time frame s based on the  date t he information was posted  on the internet site/digital medium . Marketing authorisation holders  may also consider utilising their websites to facilitate the collection of reports  of suspected adverse  reactions  (see VI.C.2.2.1 . for marketing authorisation holdersâ  responsibilities in the EU on  spontaneous reports ).  If a marketing authorisation holder becomes aware of a report of  suspected adverse reaction described  in any non-company sponsored digital medi um, the report should be assessed to determine whether it  qualifies for reporting submission  as ICSR .   Unsolicited cases  of suspected adverse reactions  from the internet or digit al media should be handled  as spontaneous reports. The same reporting submission  time frames  as for spontaneous reports should  be applied  (see VI.B.7 VI.B.7.1 . for ICSRs time frames submission ).   In relation t o cases from the internet  or digital media , the identifiability of  the reporter refers to the  possibility of verification of the existence of a real person , that is , it is possible to verify the contact  details  of the reporter  (based on the information ava ilable e.g., an email address  under a valid format                                                    13 Although not exhaustive, the following list should be considered as digital media: web site, web page, blog, vlog, social  network, interne t forum, chat room, health portal.   14 A donation (financial or otherwise)  to an organisation/site by a marketing authorisation holder does not constitute  ownership, provided that the marketing authorisation holder does not control the final content of the s ite.

If the country of the primary source is  missing, the country where the information was received , or where the review t ook place, should be  used as the primary source  country.   VI.B.1.2. Solicited reports   As defined in ICH -E2D (see GVP Annex IV GVP Annex IV ), solicited reports of suspected adverse  reactions are those derived from organised data collection systems, which include clinical trials, non - interventional studies, registries, post -approval named patient use pro grammes, other patient support  and disease management programmes, surveys of patients or healthcare providers professional s,  compassionate use or name patient use, or information gathering on efficacy or patient compliance.   Reports of suspected a dverse reactions  obtained from any of these data collection systems should not  be considered spontaneous. This is with the exception of :   ï· reports of suspected adverse reactions  in relation  to those  adverse events from non -interventional  post-authorisation studies  related to specified  adverse events for which the protocol of non- interventional post -authorisation studies  provides differently  and does not require their systematic  collection  (see VI.C.1.2.1. 1. for EU guidance on this type of non-interventional post -authorisation  studies,  and VI.6.2.3.7 Subsection 2  for EU guidance on the electronic submission of these ICSRs ),  ï· reports of suspected adverse reactions originatin g from compassionate use or named patient use  conducted in countries Member States where the  systematic active collection of adverse events   occurring in these programmes  is not required (see VI.C.1.2.2 . for EU guidance on compassionate  use or named patient use , and VI.6.2.3.7 Subsection 2  for EU guidance on the electronic  submission of these ICSRs ).   For the purpose of safety reporting With regard to the submission as ICSRs , solicited reports should be  classified as study reports . They , and should have an appropriate causality assessment , to consider  whether they refer to suspected adverse reactions and therefore meet the  minimum  validation criteria    (see VI.B.2.  for ICSR s validation )for reporting . Valid cases ICSRs  of suspected adverse reactions  should  be sentsubmitted  according to in line with  the time frames and modalities detailed in VI.B.7.  and  VI.B.8. .   General reporting rules forprinciples concerning  the management of reports of  suspected adverse  reactions occurring in organised data collection s ystem s conducted in the EU under the scope  of  Directiv e 2001/83/EC Directive 2001/83/EC , Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  Regulation (EC) No  726/2004 or Directive 2001/20/EC , are presented in VI.C.1. . Guidance on the management of solicited  reports in the EU  by marketing authorisation holders in the EU is provided in VI.C.2.2.2. .   VI.B.2. Validation  of reports   Only valid ICSRs qualify for reporting submission . In accordance  with ICH -E2D (see GVP Annex IV ), aAll  report s of suspected adverse reaction s should therefore be validated before reporting submitting  them  to the competent au thorities  to make sure  that the minimum criteria  for reporting are included in the  report s (see ICH-E2D (see ) ).   These Four minimum criteria are required  for ICSRs validation :     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 17/225     a. one or more  identifiable15 reporter  (primary source), see VI.A.2.3. VI.A.1.4. for primary source  definition ), characterised by   parameters such as a qualification  (e.g. physician, pharmacist, other  healthcare professional, lawyer, consumer or other non -healthcare professional ) , name, init ials, or  address  (e.g. reporterâs organisation, department, street, city, state or province, postcode, country,  email, phone number) . Local data protection laws might apply.   In line with ICH -E2D, the term âidentifiable â indicates that the organisation noti fied about the case  has sufficient evidence of the existence of the person who reports the facts based on the available  information. In  addition, in  accordance with ICH E2B, an ICSR is not valid for submission unless  information concerning the qualificatio n and the country is available for at least one reporter. Thus,  an ICSR is valid if the rules from ICH -E2D regarding the reporterâs identifiability  and from ICH -E2B  regarding the reporterâs qualification and country are fulfilled  for at least one reporter .   If information on the reporterâs qualification is missing , the notification should be considered by  default as a consumer  report . If information on the reporterâs country is not available , the country  where the notification  was received or where the revi ew took place should be used in the ICSR.   (e.g. physician, pharmacist, other health care professional, lawyer, consumer or other non - healthcare professional)  name , initials  or address16.and at least one of the following  parameters17:  name , address18 or phone n umber. An ICSR should not be considered valid for reporting unless  this  information is available for at least one reporter . Whenever possible, contact details for the reporter  should be recorded  so that to facilitate  follow -up activities  can be performed . However,  if the  reporter does not wish to provide contact  details  information , the ICSR should still be considered as  valid, providing  as long as  the notified organisation who was informed of the case wasis able to  confirm  it the case directly with the repo rter.   To enable  duplicate detection  activities , aAll parties providing case information or approached for  case information should be recorded  in the ICSR identifiable , (not only the initial reporter .).   When the information is ba sed on second -hand or hears ay, the report should  be considered non- valid until it can be veri fied directly with the patient, the patientâs healthcare pro fessional  or a  reporter  who ha d direct contact with the patient .;  b. one single  identifiable12 patient , characterised by at least one of the following  qualifying  descriptors : initials,  patient  identification medical record  number  (from general practitioner,  specialist, hospital,  or investigation ),  date of birth, age ,,  age group , or gestation period, or   gender.    In line with ICH -E2D, t he term âidentifiableâ refers to the possibility of verification of the existence of  a patient based on the available information.   The information should be as complete as possible  in accordance with local data protection laws. .   An ICSR should not be cons idered valid for  reporting  submission unless information is available for  at least one of the patient qualifying descriptors . Furthermore, as specified in ICH-E2D, in the  absence of a qualifying descriptor,  a report notification  referring to a definite num ber of patients  should not be regarded as valid until an individual the patient s can be characterised by one of the  aforementioned qualifying descriptors  for creating a valid ICSR .  a.  For example, âTwo patients experienced nausea with drug X  â¦â should not be considered valid   without further information ;                                                   15 In line with ICH -E2D, the term âidentifiableâ is considered in EU as referring to the possibility of verification of the  existence of a reporter and of a patient based on the information available.   16 Local data privacy laws regarding patientâs and reporterâs identifiability might apply.   17 Local data protection laws regarding reporterâs and patientâs identifiability might apply.   18 Such as reporterâs organisation, department, street, city, state/province, postcode, country, or email.      Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 18/225     b.c. one or more  suspecte d19 substance/medicinal product  (see VI.A.2.2 VI.A.1.3.  for  definition ). Interacting substances or medicinal products  are also considered susp ected .  d. one or more  suspected adverse reaction  (see VI.A.2.1 VI.A.1.1.  for definition ). Examples of  case validity assessment based on  the reporter and the patient identifiability are provided in  VI.App.8 . If the primary source has made an explicit statement that a causal relationship between  the medicinal product and the reported adverse event has been excluded and the receiver (notified  competent authority  or marketing author isation holder ) agrees with this  assessment , the report  does not qualify as a valid ICSR since the minimum information  for validation  reporting  is  incomplete  (there is no suspected adverse reaction )20.   The report also does not  also qualify as a valid ICSR if it is reported that the patient experienced an  unspecified adverse reaction and there is no information provided on the type of adverse reaction   experienced .   Similarly, t he report is  not valid if only an outcome (or consequence ) is notified  and (i) no further   information about the c linical circumstances  is provided  to consider it as a suspected adverse   reaction , or (ii)  the primary source has not indicated a possible causal relationship with the  suspected medicinal product . For instance a  marketing auth orisation holder  is made aware that a  patient was hospitalised or died , without  any further information . In this particular situation,  medical  judgement should always be applied  in deciding whet her the notified information is an   adverse reaction  or an event. For example,  a report of sudden death would usually need to be  considered as a case of suspected  adverse reaction  and reported the valid ICSR should be submitted   to the competent authorities .  The lack of any of these the four elements means that the case is considered incomplete and does not  qualify for reporting submission  as ICSR . Competent authorities  and marketing authorisation holders   are expected to exercise due diligence  in following - up the case  to collect the missing data elements .  and follow-up ac tivities should be documented.  Reports,  for which the minimum information is  incomplete , should  nevertheless be recorded within the pharmacovigilance system for use in on -going  safety evaluation activities.    Recommendations on the electronic reporting of valid ICSRs , when When the missing information has  been obtained  (including for example  when the medicinal product  causal relationship  with the reported  adverse event  is no longer excluded ), the ICSR becomes valid  for submission and the EU guidance  are  provided in VI.C.6.2.3.8. should be followed .   When collecting reports of suspected adverse reactions via the internet or digital media, the term  âidentifiableâ refers to the possibility of verification of the existen ce of a reporter and a patient  (see  VI.B.1.1.4 .)...   Further guidance is available in  VI.C.6.2.2.10.  for the electronic reporting submission  in the EU of  ICSRs where  primary source information cannot be transmitted  for data protection considerations .   When one party ( competent authority  or a marketing authorisation holder) is made aware that the  primary source may also have reported the suspected adverse reaction to a nother concerned party,  the valid report should still be submitted considered as a valid ICSR. All the relevant information  necessary for the detection of the duplicate case  should be included in the ICSR21. GEU guidance on                                                   19 Interacting med ications are also considered suspected.   20 There is no suspected adverse reaction .  21 For further guidance on reporting of other duplicate ICSRs , refer to section A.1.11 âOther case identifiers in previous  transmissionâ of ICH-E2B(R2)  (see GVP Annex IV ).     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 19/225     the electronic transmission submis sion of information allowing the detection of duplicate ICSRs in line  with ICH -E2B is provided in  VI.C.6.2.2.6 ..   A valid case of suspected adverse reaction initially submitted reported notified  by a consumer cannot be  downgraded  to a report  of non -related adverse event  if the a contacted healthcare professional  (nominated by the consumer for follow -up information) subsequently disagrees with the consumer âs  suspicion  (see VI.A.2. 2.1.VI.A.2. 2.1.VI.A.1. 21. for causality definition ). In this situation, the opinion s  of both the consumer and  the healthcare professional should be included  detailed  in the  narrative  section of the ICSR. This information can also b e submitted  in a structured manner  in ICH-E2B format ,  which provides  the mean s to transmit  the degree of suspected relatedness  expressed by several  primary sources for each reported drug event combination.   Guidance on the reporting  of the medical confirma tion of a case, provided in ICH-E2B(R2)   Section  A.1.14 (âWas the case medically confirmed, if not initially from a healthcare professional?â)  (see GVP  Annex IV ),VI.A.2.3.  should be followed .   Similarly ,For a solicited report s of suspected adverse reaction s should not be downgraded to a report  of non-related adverse event ,(see VI.B.1.2 .), where  when the receiver notified recipient (competent  authority or marketin g authorisation holder)  disagrees with the  reasonable possibility of causal  relationship between the suspected medicinal product  and the adverse reaction  expressed by the  primary source  on the supplied medicinal product , the case  should not be downgraded  to a report of  non-not causally related adverse event . The opinion s of both, the primary source and the  recipient receiver , should be recorded in the narrative section of the ICSR or in structured manner  in  line with ICH -E2B.   The same principle applies to t he ICSR seriousness criterion, which should not be downgraded from  serious to non -serious if the receiver notified recipient  disagrees with the seriousness reported by the  primary source.   VI.B.3. Follow -up of reports   When first received, t he information in suspected adverse reaction s reports  may be incomplete. These  reports  should be followed -up as necessary to obtain supplementary detailed information significant  for  the scientific evaluation of the cases . This is particularly relevant  for monitored e vents of special  interest , prospective reports of pregnancy  (see VI.B.6.1.  for guidance on the management of  pregnancy  reports ), cases  notifying  the death of  a patient , or cases  reporting  new risks  or changes in  the known r isks. This is in addition to any effort  to collect missing minimum information criteria  for  reports validation reporting (see VI.B.2 . for ICSR s validation ). Any attempt to obtain follow -up  information should be documented.   The provision in ICSRs of information on the patientâs age  information  is important in order to be able  to identify safety issues occurring specifically in the paediatric or elderly population. All  possible Reasonable  efforts should be mad e to follow -up on an individual case ICSRs where information  on the patientâs  to obtain age information or age group  of the patient, where it is initially not reported  by the primary source (see VI.B.6.2.  for guidance on paedia tric or elderly population ).  Similarly, f or suspected adverse reactions relat ed to biological medicinal products, the definite  identification of the concerned product s with regard to their manufacturing is of particular importance.  Therefore, all appropria te measures should be taken to clearly identify the name s of the product s and  their batch number s. With respect to this, it is recommended to specify in the case narrative if  information on the batch number has been requested, when it is missing in the ini tially submitted  ICSR. The business process map and a process description in VI.App.1.1.  take into account the     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 20/225     mandatory follow -up in the EU of information for the identification of suspected biological medicin al  products .   For cases related to vaccines,  GVP Product - or Population -Specific Considerations I: Vaccines for   prophylaxis against infectious diseases  and GVP Product - or Population -Specific Considerations II:  Biological  medicinal products  should also be followed as appropriate.       Any attempt to obtain follow -up information should be documented.    Follow -up methods should be tailored towards optimi sing the collection of missing information. This  should be done in ways that encourage the primary source to submit new information relevant for the  scientific evaluation  of a particular safety concern. The use of targeted specific forms in the local  language should avoid requesting the primary source  to repeat  information alrea dy provided in the  initial report and/or to complete extensive questionnaires, which could discourage future spontaneous  reporting.  Therefore, c onsideration should be given to pre -populating some data fields  in those follow - up report forms  to make their completion by the primary source easy.   Further requirements applicable to competent authorities in Member States  and to marketing  authorisation holders are provided respectively in VI.C.2.1.  and VI.C.2.2. . with business process maps  and process descriptions included in  . Guidance on the electronic reporting  of follow -up reports is  available in VI.C.6.2.2.7 ..   When information is received directly from a consumer  suggesting that an adverse reaction may have  occurred , and if the information is incomplete,  attempt s should be made to  obtain follow -up with the  consumer to collect  further information and to obtain consent to contact a nominated healthcare  professional to obtain  further follow -up information.  When  such a the case, initially reported by a  consumer,  has been  is subsequently  confirmed (totally or partially ) by a healthcare professional,  theis  informat ion medical confirmation  should be clearly highlighted captured  in the ICSR  in line with ICH - E2B (see VI.A.1.4.  for healthcare professional s definition , and VI.A.1.5.  for ICSRs medical  confirmation )22.  in line with ICH -E2B (see VI.A.2.3 .).   For suspected adverse reaction s relating to biological medicinal products, the definite identification of  the concerned produ ct with regard to its manufacturing is of particular importance. Therefore,  all  appropriate measures should be taken to clearly identify the name of the product and the batch  number . A business proces s map  and a process description  in relation to  the manda tory follow -up of  information for the identification of suspected biological medicinal products  isare presented in  VI.Appendix 1. .VI.App .1.4.   For cases r elated to vaccines,   should also be followed as appropriate.     For some  individual cases  related to medication errors that result in harm , it may not always be  possible to perform follow -up activities taking into account that the primary source reporter  information  may have been anonymised in accordance with l ocal legal requirements or due to provisions that allow  for anonymous reporting  (see VI.C.6.2.2.10.  for guidance on the processing of personal data in the  EU), for example   in case of medication error with harm and the reporter does not wish to disclose an  identity . These  cases  should be considered valid for submission as ICSRs , providing that the notified  organisation was able to confirm them directly with the primary sources  and that the other minimum  criteria  for reports validation  are satisfied  (see VI.B.2.  for ICSR s validation ).                                                    22 For further guidance on reporting  this information, refer to ICH-E2B(R2) , section A.1.14 (âWas the case medically  confirmed, if not initially from a healthcare professional?â) (see GVP Annex IV ).     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 21/225     Further EU guidance on follow -up activities applicable to competent authorities in Member States  and  to marketing authorisation ho lders is provided respectively in VI.C.2.1.  and VI.C.2.2. . with business  process maps and process descriptions included in  VI.App.1.1.  and VI.Ap.1.2. . Guidance on the  electronic submission in the EU of follow -up reports is available in VI.C.6.2.2.7. .   VI.B.4. Data management   Electronic data and paper reports of suspected adverse reactions  should be stored and treated in the  same way as other medical records with appropriate respect for confidentiality  regarding patient sâ and  reporter sâ identifia bility and in acc ordance with localapplicable  data privacy protection  laws.  Confidentiality of patients' records including personal identifiers, if provided, should always be  maintained. Identifiable personal details of reporting healthcare professiona ls should be kept in  confidence ,. protected from unauthorised access . With regard s to patientâs and reporterâs identifiability,   case report information should be transmitted between stakeholders (marketing authorisation holders  or competent authorities) in accordance with local  data privacy protection  laws (see  VI.C.6.2.2.8 .VI.C.6.2.2. 10. for guidance on the processing of personal data in ICSRs in the EU).   In order to To ensure pharmacovigilance data security and confidentiality , strict access control   measure s should be applied  in place to provide access to documents and to databases only to  authorised personnel  only. This security measure should be extend eds to the complete data path. In  this asp ectWith regard to this , procedures should be implemented to ensure security and non - corruption of data during data transfer.   When transfer of pharmacovigilance data occurs within an organisation or between  organisations   having concluded set up contractual agreements , the mechanism should be such that there is  confidence that all notifications are received ; in that , a confirmation and/or reconciliation process  should be  undertaken.   Correct d ata entry, including t he appropriate use of terminologies , should b e verified  by quality  assurance auditing , either systematically or by regular random evaluation. Data entry staff should be  instructed in the use of the terminologies, and their proficiency confirmed.    Data received from the primary source should be treate d in an u nbiased and unfiltered way and  inferences as well as  imputation s should be avoided  during data entry or electronic  transmission submission . The reports  should include the verbatim text  as used by the primary source  orandor an accurate translation o f it. where applicable (see VI.C.6.2.2.11.  for EU guidance on  languages management in ICSRs) .(see  for EU requirements on languages handling ). The original  verbatim text  should be coded using the appropriate t erminology as described in VI.B.8 .. In order to To  ensure cons istency in the coding practices,  it is recommended to use , where applicable, the translation  of the terminology in the local language  to code the verba tim text .   Electronic data s torage should allow traceability (audit trail) of all data entered or modified, including  dates and sources of received data, as well as dates and destinations of transmitted data.   A procedure sh ould be in place to account for i dentification and management of duplicate cases at data  entry and during the generation of aggregated reports (see VI.C.6.2.4 . for EU guidance  on duplicate  management ).  VI.B.5. Quality management   Competent author ities and marketing authori sation holders should have a quality management system  in place to ensure compliance with the necessary quality standards at every stage of case  documentation,  such as  data collection, data transfer, data management , data coding , case validation,     Guideline on good pharmac ovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 22/225     case evaluation , case follow -up, ICSR reporting  submission and case archiving  (see VI.C.6.2.4 . and  GVP Module I  for EU guidance  on data quality of ICSRs ).   Correct data entry, including t he appropriate use of terminologies  (see VI.B.8.  for ICSRs content and  format ), should be monitored  by quality controlled assurance auditing , either systematically or by  regular random evaluation. Conformity of stored data with initial and follow -up reports should be  verified  by quality control proc edures, which per mit for the validation against the original data or  images thereof. In this aspect With regard to this , the source data (e.g. , letters, emails, records of  telephone calls that calls, which  include details of an event) or an image of the source data should be   easily accessible. The whole process should be monitored by quality assurance audits.   Clear written standard operating procedures should guarantee  that the roles and responsibilities and  the required tasks are clear to all parties involved and that there is provision for proper control and,  when needed, change of the system. This is equally applicable to activities that are contracted out to  third parties , whose  procedures should be reviewed to verify  that they are adequate and compliant  with applicable re quirements.   Staff directly performing pharmacovigilance activities , should be appropriately trained in applicable  pharmacovigilance legislation and guidelines , in addition to specific training in report  process ing  activities for which they are responsible  and/or undertake . Data entry staff should be instructed in the  use of the  appropriate standards and  terminologies  (see VI.B.8.  for ICSRs content and format ), and  their proficiency confirmed  (see VI.C.6.2.4.  for EU guidance on training of personnel for  pharmacovigilance ). Other personnel who may receive or process safety reports (e.g. clinical  development, sales, medical information, legal, quality control) should be train ed in adverse  event s/reactions  collection and reporting submission  to the pharmacovigilance department in  accordance with internal policies and procedures .  VI.B.6. Special situations   VI.B.6.1. Use of a medicinal product du ring pregnancy or breastfeeding    a. Pregnancy   Reports , where the embryo or foetus may have been exposed to medicinal products (either through  maternal exposure and/or if the suspect ed medicinal product was taken by the father transmission of a  medicinal product via semen following paternal exposure ), should be followed -up in order to collect  information on the outcome of the pregnancy and the development of the child  after birth . The  recommendations guidance  provided in the Guideline on the Exposure to Medicinal Products during  Pregnancy: N eed for Post-Authorisation Data (see GVP Annex III ) and in GVP Product - or Population - Specific Considerations  III. should be considered as regard s the monitoring, collection and reporting  submission  of information in these specific situations in order to facilitate the scientific evaluation.   When an active substance (or one of its metabolites)  has a long half -life, this sho uld be taken into  account when assessing  the possibility of exposure  of the embryo  through  the mother and/or the  father , if the medicinal product was taken before conception.      Not infrequently, pre gnant women or healthcare professionals will contact either competent authorities   or marketing authorisation holders  to request  information on the teratogen icity of a medicinal product  and/or on the experience of use during pregnancy.  Reasonable attempt s should be made to obtain  information on any possible medicinal product exposure to a n embryo or  foetus  and to follow -up on the  outcome  of the pregnancy  (see VI.B.3.  for follow -up guidance ).      Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 23/225     Reports  of exposure to m edicinal products during pregnancy should contain  as many detailed elements  as possible in order  to assess the causal relationship s between any reported adverse events reaction s  and the exposure to the suspected medicinal product.  In this context the use of standard structur ed  questionnaires is recommended.   Individual cases with an abnormal outcome associated with a medicinal product  following exposure  during pregnancy  are classified  as serious reports and should be reported submitted , in accordance with  the requirements outlined in VI.B.7.23. and in line with the guidance  provided in  VI.C.6.2.3.1.  for the  electronic reporting submission  of those ICSRs in the EU  recommenda tions provided in .  This especially refers to:   a. reports of congenital anomalies  or development al delay,  in the foetus  or the child;   b. reports of foetal death and spontaneous abortion; and   c. reports of suspected adverse reactions in the neonate that are classifie d as serious.   Other cases, such as reports of induced termination of pregnancy without informat ion on congenital  malformation, reports of pregnancy exposure without outcome data , or reports which have a normal  outcome , should not be reported submitted  as ICSRs since there is no suspected adverse reaction  (see  VI.B.2.  for ICSR validation ). These reports should however be collected and discussed  in the periodic  safety update reports ( see GVP Module VII  and VI.C.6.2.3.1. Subsection c  for the management of the   individual reports  in the EU ).     However, i In certain circumstances, reports of pregnancy exposure with no suspected reactions may  necessitate to be reported .submitted  as ICSRs . This may be a condition o f the marketing authorisation  or stipulated in the risk ma nagement plan; for example pregnancy exposure to medicinal products  contraindicated in pregnancy or medicinal products with a special need for surveillance because of a  high teratogenic potential  (e.g. thalidomide, isotretinoin).   A signal of a possible ter atogen effect (e.g. through a cluster of similar abnormal outcomes) should be  notified immediately  to the competent authorities  in accordance with the recommendations guidance  presented in  VI.C.2.2. 6 GVP Module  IX.  b. Breastfeeding   The g uidance provided in  GVP Product - or Population -Specific Considerations  III. on the conduct of  pharmacovigilance for medicines exposed via breastfeeding  should be follo wed. Suspected a dverse  reactions which  occur  in infants following exposure to a medicinal product from breast milk  should be  reported submitted  in accordance with the criteria outlined in VI.B.7 .24. and in line with the  guidance   provided in  VI.C.6.2.3.1.  for the electronic  submission  of those ICSRs in the EU recommendations on  electronic reporting provided in  VI.C.6.2.3.1. .  VI.B.6. 2. Use of a medicinal product in  a paediatric  or elderly  population   The collection of safety information in the paediatric  or elderly  population is importan t. Reasonable   attempt s should therefore be made  to obtain  and submit  the age or age group of the pat ient when a  case is reported by a healthcare professional, or consumer  in order to be able to identify  potential                                                   23 See VI.C.6.2.3.1  for electronic reporting recommendations in the EU.   24 See Footnote 16 .

General guidance in VI.B.3.  on reports follow -up  should be applied.   As regards the paediatric population, t he guidance published by the Agency25Guidance provided in    GVP Product - or Population -Specific Considerations  IV. on the conduct of pharmacovigilance in thisfor  medicines used in the paediatric population, and in   GVP Product - or Population -Specific Considerations   V. on the conduct of pharmacovigilance for medicines used in the elderly geriatric  population  should be  followed.    VI.B.6.3. Reports of overdose , abuse, off-label use, misuse , medication  error  or occupational exposure   For the purpose of this Module, medication error refers to  any unintentional error in the prescribing,  dispensing , or administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the healthcare p rofessional  or consumer.   The d Definitions offor overdose, abuse, off-label use, misuse, medication error or occupational  exposure are detailed provided  in VI.A.1.2.  should be applied .   Reports of overdose , abuse , off-label use, misuse , medication error  or occupational exposure  with no  associated suspected  adverse reaction  should not be reported submitted  as ICSRs . They  should be   recorded  when becoming aware of them  and considered in the periodic safety update report s as  applicable  (see GVP Module VII ). When those reports constitute safety issues impac ting on the risk - benefit balance of the medicinal product s authorised in the EU , they  should be notified to the  competent authorities  in Member States and to the Agency  in accordance with the  recommendation guidance s provided in VI.C.2.2 .6..  Reports  associated with suspected adverse reactions should be  subject to  reporting  submission  in  accordance with the criteria modalities  outlined in VI.B.7 . and with the electronic reporting submission   requirements in the EU described in VI.C.6.2.3.3 . They should be routinely followed -up to ensure that  the information is as complete as possible with regard s to the symptoms, treatments suspecte d  medicinal products name , outcomes , context of occurrence (e.g. , error in prescription, administration,  dispensing , dosage , unauthorised indication or population, etc. ).   With regards to reports of medication errors, further guidance concerning their mana gement and  assessment, provided in the Good Practice Guide on Recording, Coding, Reporting and Assessment of  Medicati on Errors26, should be followed.   Guidance  is available in VI.C.2.2.12.  with regard to the management in the EU of reported information  on the off-label use of medicinal products .   VI.B.6.4. Lack of therapeutic e fficacy   Reports of lack of therapeutic efficacy  should be collected and recorded when notified and followed -up  if incomplete. They  should not normally not be reported , butsubmitted  as ICSRs  if there is no  associated suspected adverse reaction , but they should be discussed in periodic safety update report s  as applicable . (see GVP Module VII ). Howeve r, i  In certain circumstances , these reports of lack of  therapeutic efficacy  with no  suspected adverse  reactions  may require to be  reported submitted  within a 15 -day time frame  (see VI.C.6.2.3.4 . as                                                   25 Guideline on conduct of pharmacovigilance for medicines used by the paediatric population .  26 Ref.: EMA/762563/2014 EMA/762563/2014 ; EMA website: Home/ Human regulatory/  Post-authorisation/  Pharmacovigilance/ Medication errors      Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 25/225     regards for EU guidance  on the electronic  reporting management  of these ICSRs in the EU ). Medicinal  products used  in critical conditions or  for the treatment of life -threatening diseases, vaccines ,  contraceptives are exa mples of such cases . This applies  unless the reporte r has specifically stated that  the outcome  was due to disease progression and was not related  to the medicinal product.  The  requirement to submit  these  specific  reports of lack of efficacy does not apply when the notification  occurred in the frame of a non -interventional post-authorisation efficacy study . This is because they  refer to the main end point of the study. For those efficacy studies, the requirements EU guidance   provided in VI.C.1.2.1.  for non -interventional post -authorisation studies should be followed  regarding   the management of adverse events  occurring in those  efficacy studies .  Clinical  judgement should be used  when  considering if other cases of lack of therapeutic efficacy  qualify for reportingsubmission as ICSR s. For example, a report of lack of therapeutic efficacy with an  antibiotic  used in a life-threatening situation  where the use of the medicinal product was not in fact  appropriate for the i nfective agent should not be reported submitt ed. However, a  report of  lack of  therapeutic efficacy for a life-threatening infection , where the lack of therapeutic efficacy which  appear s  to be due to the development of a newly resistant strain of a bacterium pr eviously regarded as  susceptible , should b e reported submitted  as ICSR  within 15 days .   For vaccines, cases of lack of therapeutic prophylactic  efficacy should be reported submitted  as ICSRs ,  in particular with the view to hig hlight potential signals of reduced immunogenicity in  a sub -group of  vaccin ees, waning immunity, or strain replacement. With regard to the latter, it is considered that  spontaneously reported cases of lack of therapeutic prophylactic  efficacy by a healthcare professional  may constitute a signal of strain replacement. Such a signal may need prompt action and further  investigation through post -authorisation safety studies as appropriate. General guidance regarding the  monitoring of  vaccines failure , provided  in the Report of CIOMS/WHO Working Group  on Vaccine  Pharmacovigilance27, may be followed.    VI.B.7. Reporting Submission of individual case safety reports (I CSRs )  Only valid ICSR s (see VI.B.2. for ICSR s validation ) should  be reported submitted . The clock for the  reporting submission  of a valid ICSR starts as soon as the information containing the minimum  reporting criteria has been brought to the attention of  the national or regional pharmacovigilance  centre of a competent authority  or of any personnel of the marketing authorisation holder , including  medical representatives  and contractors . This date should be considered as day zero. It is the first day  when a notified competent authority or marketing authorisation holder receiver  gains  gets knowledge  of  a valid ICSR, irrespective of whether  the information is received during a week end or public holiday.   Reporting tThe timelines for submission are based on calendar days.   Where the marketing authorisation holder has set up contractual arrangements with a person or an  organisation, explicit pro cedures and detailed agreements should exist between the marketing  authorisation holder and the person/organisation to ensure that the marketing authorisation holder can  comply with the reporting obligations submission of valid ICSRs  within the appropriate time frames .  These procedures should in particular  specify the processes for  the exchange of safety information,  including the timelines and  responsibilities for the  regulatory reporting submission of valid  ICSRs .responsibilities and They should be organis ed in order  to avoid the submission of duplicate   ICSRs  reporting  to the competent authorities .                                                   27 Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS).

Where  contractual arrangements are made with a person/organisation to perform literature searches and/or  report submit  valid ICSRs, detailed agreement s should exist to ensure that the marketing authorisation  holder can comply with its regulatory submission the reporting obligations.    When additional significant  information is received for a previously reported submitted  case, the  reporting time clock starts again for the submission of a follow -up report  starts again  from the da te of  receipt of the relevant follow -up information. For the purpose of reporting submission of ICSRs ,  significant  follow -up information corresponds to new medical or administrative information that could  impact on the assessment or management of a case, or could change its se riousness criteria; non - significant  information includes updated comments on the case assessmen t, or corrections of  typographical errors in the previous case ver sion. See also VI.C.6.2.2.7 . as regard sing the distinction  between s ignificant and non -significant follow -up information  for the submission of ICSRs in the EU .  VI.B.7.1. Reporting Submission time fr ames  of ICSRs   In general , the reporting submission  of serious valid ICSRs is required as soon a s possible, but in no  case later than 15 calendar days after initial receipt of the information by the national or regional  pharmacovigilance centre of a compete nt authority  or by any personnel of the marketing authorisation  holder , including medical representatives and contractors . This applies to initial and follow -up  information.  Where a  case initially reported sent as serious becomes  non-serious , based on new f ollow- up information,  this information should still be reported submitted  within 15 days; the reporting  submission  time frame for non -serious reports should then be applied for the subsequent  follow -up  reports .  Information as regards the reporting submissio n time frame of non -serious valid ICSRs in the EU is  provided in VI.C.3..  ICH-E2B provides a mechanism to the sen der to indicate whether the case fulfils the local expedited  requirements . Further EU guidance  on this aspect is provided in VI.C.3. .  VI. B.7.2 Report nullification   The nullification of a report should be used to indicat e that a previously transmitted  ICSR is considered  completely voi d (nullified) , for example when  the whole c ase was found to be erroneous . EU gGuidance  on ICSRs  nullification in line with ICH -E2B is provided in  VI.C.6.2.2.10. VI.C.6.2.2.9. .   VI.B.7.3. Amendment  report   There may be instances, where a n ICSRreport  which has already been submitted may need to be  amended for example when, after an internal review or accor ding to an expert opinion  some items  have been corrected , (such as adverse event/reaction terms, seriousn ess, seriousness criteria or  causality assessment ) but without receipt of new information that would warrant submission of a  follow -up report . The same would apply where documentation s mentioned in an ICSRs, translations or  literature articles are requeste d by competent authorities the Agency or other Member States and are  further sent as attachments in line with ICH E2B(R3). These submissions are considered as amendment  reports.  Further EU guidance on the amendment of ICSRs in line with ICH-E2B is provided  in  VI.C.6.2.2.8 ..

Reporting mModalit ies for submission  of individual case safety  reports (ICSRs)   Taking into account Given  the international dimension of adverse reaction s reporting and the need to  achieve harmonisation  and high quality between all involved parties , ICSRs  should be submitted  electronically  as structured data  with the use of controlled vocabularies for the relevant data elements  where applicable .   In this aspect , wWith regard to the conte nt and format of electronic ICSRs,  competent authorities  and  marketing authorisation holders should adhere to the following internationally agreed  ICH28 guidelines  and standards  (see GVP Annex IV ) taking into count the transition from ICH -E2B(R2) to ICH -E2B(R3)  formats :  ï· the ICH M1 terminology - Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  (see GVP Annex  IV), which should be used at the lowest level term (LLT) level forin the transmission of  ICSRs ;.

Operation of the EU network   Section VI.C of this Module highlights the EU specific requirements , as defined in Directive 2001/83/EC  [DIR] and Regulation (EC)  No 726/2004  [REG] , in relation to the collection, management and reporting  submission  of reports of suspected adverse reaction s (serious and non -serious)  associated with  medicinal products for human use authorised in the EU , , independent lyirrespective of the  product sir  condition s of use  within or outside the terms of t he marketing authorisation in the EU . They These  requirements  are applicable to competent authorities in Member States and/or to marketing  authorisation holders  in the EU .   Section C  should be read in conjunction  with tThe definitions and general principle s detailed in  Sections   VI.A. and VI.B. of this Module  and with the requirements provided in chapter s IV, V and IX of the  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012 [IR]should be applied in conjunction with the  guidance provided in this Section . The requirements provided in Chapters IV, V and IX of the   Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012 [IR] on the u se of terminology, formats and  standards , on th e submission  of reports of suspected adverse reactions , and on the processing of  personal data shall also be followed .  In accordance with Article 107 of Directive 2001/83/EC, marketing authorisation holders have to  submit in addition to information on adve rse reactions that occur in the EU, information on serious  suspected adverse reactions that occur in third countries.  Given that a medicinal product is authorised  with a defined composition,  all the  adverse reactions suspected to be related to any of the active  substance s being part of a medicinal product authorised in the EU should be managed in accordance  with the requirements presented in this Module . This is valid irrespective  of the strengths,  pharmaceutical forms, routes of administration, presentatio ns, authorised  indications , or names of the  medicinal product  (see VI.C.2.2 . for detailed requirements applicable to marketing authorisation  holders ). For the definition of the name and strength of a me dicinal product, refer to Art icle 1(20) and  1(22)  of Directive 2001/83/EC .     The guidance provided in this Module also applies  to   ï· homeopathic and herbal medicinal products with the exception of homeopathic medicinal products  authorised under the special simplified registration procedure detailed in Art icle 14 (1)  of Directive  2001/83/EC  [DIR Art 16 (3) and Art 16g], and  to  ï· medicinal products supplied in the context of compassionate use  as defined in Article 83(2)  of  Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 , subject to  and without prejudice to the applicable national law s of  EU Member States . As the case may be, this guidance may also apply to named patient use as  defined under Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC  (see VI.C.1.2.2 . for ICSRs management in   compassionate use  and named patient use ).   For devices containing active substances, the procedure to be followed for the submission of individual  reports of suspected adverse reactions and/or incidents varies dependin g if these devices have been  authorised in the EU as an integral part of medicinal products (products covered by the second  paragraph of Article 1(3) of Directive 93/42/EEC) or CE marked as medical devices. With regard to  this, devices authorised as an int egral part of medicinal products follow the pharmacovigilance  requirements provided in Directive 2001/83/EC  and Regulation (EC)  No 726/2004 , whereas devices CE  marked  as medical devices follow the requirements for medical device vigilance  given in Directiv e  90/385/EEC and Directive 93/42/EEC. As detailed in the G uidelines on a Medical Devices Vigilance     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 30/225     System31, a medical device incorporating a medicinal product or substance , where the action of the  medicinal product or substance is a ncillary to that of the device, follows the legal requirements of  Directive  90/385/EEC and Directive 93/42/EEC .

Management of individual safety reports  Repor ting rules for  clinical trials   A suspected adverse reaction to an investigational medicinal product (IMP) occurring in a  clinical trial  which falls under the scope of  Directive 2001/20/EC . It is only to be addressed  by the sponsor based  on the requirements  detailed in  that Directive. It is therefore excluded from the scope of this Module ,  even if the clinical trial where the suspected adverse reaction occurred is a post-authorisation safety or  efficacy studyclinical trial , imposed in line with  Article 21a of Directive 2001/83/EC  and Article 9(4) of  Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 , requested in accordance with Directive 2 001/83/E C or Regulation (EC)  No 726/2004 , Article 22a of Directive 2001/83/EC  and Article 10a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 , or  if it is conduc ted voluntarily  by a marketing authorisation holder .   If a clinical trial , conducted under the scope of  Directive 2001/20/EC , yields safety concerns which  impact o n the risk -benefit balance of an authorised medicinal product, the competent authorities in t he  Member States where the medicinal product is authorised and the Agency should be notified  immediately in accordance with the modalities detailed in VI.C.2.2.6 ... This applies as well if a safety  concern arise s from a clinical trial conducted exclusively outside the EU.   The safety data from clinical trials to be presented in the relevant sections of the periodic safety  update report of the authorised medicinal product are detailed in GVP Module VII .   Where Where a n untoward and unintended response originating from a clinical trial conducted in  accordanc e with Directive 2001/20/EC , is suspected to be related only to a non -investigational  medicinal product (or another medicinal product , which is not part of other than the clinical trial  protocol) IMP or NIMP  and does not result from a possible interaction wi th the investigational medicinal  product IMP or NIMP , it does not follow the expedited reporting requirements  of Directive 2001/20/EC ,  which apply only to the investigational medicinal product . an untoward and unintended response from  a clinical trial conducted in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC is suspected to be related only  to a  medicinal product other than the IMP and does not result from a possible  interaction with the IMP, it  should be managed in line with  the requirements provided in Art 107(3) and 107a( 4) of Directive  2001/83/EC . The same applies whe n the adverse reaction is suspected to be related only to an  authorised non -investigational medicinal product (NIMP)34. In this context, t The investigator or the  sponsor is encouraged to report the ca se to the competent authorit y in the Member State  where the  reaction occurred or to the marketing authorisation holder  of the su spected medicinal product , but not  to both to avoid duplicate reporting ICSRs submission35.

Management of individual safety reports  Reporting rules for non - interventional post-authorisation studies , compassionate use and named  patient use   This Section chapter  applies  to non -interventional post-authorisation studies , compassionate use and  named patient use . For th ese org anised data collection schemes,  a system  should be put in place  to  record and document complete  and comprehensive case information  on solicited adverse  events  36(see  GVP Annex I VI.A.1.1.  and GVP Annex I  for defi nition ) which  need to be collected as specified in  VI.C.1.2.1.  and in VI.C.1.2.2 .. These   In line with ICH -E2D (see GVP Annex IV ), these  collected adverse events should be systematically  assessed to determine whether the y are possibly related to the studied (or supplied) medicinal  product s (see ICH-E2D (see GVP Annex IV )).. A method of causality assessment should be applied for  assessing the causal role of the studied (or supplied)  medicinal product s in the occurrence of the  solicited  adverse event s (for example,  the WHO-UMC system System for Sstandardised case Case  causality Causality aAssessment37). An adverse event should be classified as an adverse reaction, if  there is at least a reasonable possibility of causal relation ship with the product .    Only valid ICSRs  (see VI.B.2 .) Reports of adverse reactions , which are  , suspected to be related to the  studied (or supplied) medicinal product  by the primary source or  by the notified organisation ,receiver   of the case , should be reported classified and submitted  in accordance with the guidance requirements   provided in VI.C.1.2.1. , VI.C.1.2 .2. ,  and VI.C.6 .2.3.7. . Depending o n the seriousness and country of  origin of the suspected reaction , the submission time  frames and modalities detailed in VI.C.3 . and  VI.C.4.  should be applied. Other reports of adverse events should be summarised as part of any  interim safety analysis and  in the final study report, where applicable.     In situations where  an adverse reaction s isare suspected to be related to a medicinal product s other  than the  studied (or supplied) medicine  and does not result from a possible interaction  with it, these  report s should be managed, classified  and reported submitted  as spontaneous  ICSRs. They It should be  notified  by the primary source  (healthcare professional  or consumer ) to the competent authority in the  Member State  where the reaction  s occurred  or to the marketing authorisation holder  of the suspected  medicinal product , but not to both (to avoid dupl icate reporting ICSRs submission ).   Where made aware, in the frame of th ese organised data collection schemes, of events which affect  the known risk -benefit balance of the studied (or supplied ) medicinal product and/or impact on public  health, the marketing  authorisation holder should notify the concerned competent authorities and the  Agency in accordance with the modalities detailed in VI.C.2.2.6. .  Further guidance on post -authorisation studies conducted by marke ting authorisation holders is  provided in VI.C.2.2.2 ..  The requirements provided in this Module do not apply to non-interventional post -authorisation studies  conducted by organisations  such as academia, medical rese arch charities or research organisations in  the public sector . These organisations should follow the local requirements as regards the reporting  submission of cases of suspected adverse reactions to the compet ent authority in the Member State  where the rea ction occurred . However, where a study conducted by one of these  organisation s is  directly initiated, managed ,  financed or financed  by a marketing authorisation holder , or where its  design is controlled by a marketing authorisation holder  (voluntarily or p ursuant to obligations imposed  in accordance with Articleicles 21a and or 22a of Directive 2001/83/EC , orof Directive 2001/83/EC  and  Articleicles 10 9(4) and  or 10(a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 )) of Regulation 726/2004 ), the                                                   36See GVP Annex I  for definition of adverse event.   37 https://www.who -umc.org/      Guideline on good  pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 34/225     requirements provided in th is Module are applicable38. In this context, contractual agreements should  be in place to clearly define the role and responsibilities of each party for implementing these   requirements  (see GVP Module I ).  VI.C.1.2.1. Non-interventional post-authorisation studies   Non-interventional post-authorisation studies39 (see GVP Annex I ) should be distinguished between   ï· Studies those with a design based on primary data collection directly from healthcare pro fessionals  or consumers  (i.e. where the events of interest are collected as they occur specifically for the  study ), and   ï· sStudiesy with a design s which are based on the secondary use of data  (i.e. where the events of  interest have already occurred  and have  been collected for another purpose ).   Depending on the study design, the requirements provided hereafter in VI.C.1.2.1.1.  and VI.C.1.2.1.2.   apply40.   For combined stud ies with a design  based on  both primary data collection and secondary use of data,  the submission of ICSRs is required exclusively fo r the data obtained through primary data collection  and the guidance provided  hereafter  in VI.C.1.2.1. 1. should be followed . For the events identified  through  secondary use of data, the guidance in VI.C.1.2.1. 2. applies . All adverse eve nts/reactions  collected as part of this type of stud ies should be recorded and summarised in the interim safety  analysis and in the final study report.    In case of doubt, the management o f individual safety reports reporting requirement s should be  clarifie d with the concerned competent authorit yies in the Member State s.   National legislation should be followed as applicable regarding  the obligations towards local ethics  committees .   VI.C.1.2.1. 1. Non-interventional post -authorisation studies with a design b ased on primary  data collection   Information on  all adverse events  should be collected and recorded from healthcare professionals or  consumers in the course of the study unless the protocol provides differently  with a due justification for  not collecting certain adverse events . Any reference to adverse events that are not collected should be  made using the appropriate level of the MedDRA classification (see GVP Module VIII).   For all collected adverse events, c omprehensive and high quality information should be sought  in a  manner which allow for valid ICSRs to be reported submitted  within the appropriate time  frames  (see  VI.C.3. ).For all collected adverse events,  cases Cases of adverse reactions, which are suspected to be  related to the studied medicinal product by the primary source or the receiver of the case notified  organisatio n, should be recorded in the pharmacovigilance database  and reported submitted  as ICSRs  in accordance with the requirements time frames and modalities  provided in VI.C.3.  and VI.C.4. . Valid  ICSRs They should be classified as solicited reports (s(seeee summary in Table VI.1. , and  VI.6.2.3.7  Subsection 1  for guidance on the  electronic submission of thes e ICSRs )VI.C.2.2.2 . and VI.C.6.2.3.7. ).

In certain  circum stances , suspected adverse reactions with fatal outcome may not be subject to  expedited  reporting submission as ICSR s, for example because they refer to  study  outcomes  (efficacy end  points), because the patients included in the study have a disease with h igh mortality, or because the  fatal outcomes have no relation to the objective of the study.  For these particular situations, the  rational e for not reporting submitting  as ICSRs certain adverse reactions with fatal outcome s should be  clearly described in t he protocol .  together with a list using the appropriate level of the MedDRA  classification  (see GVP Module VII I).  All collected  adverse events collected during the study should be summarised  as part of any in the  interim safety analysis and in the final study report.    For adverse events specified in the study protocol which are not systematically collected for whic h the  protocol  provides differently and  does not require their systematic collection , healthcare professionals  and consumers should be informed in the protocol (or other study documents) of the possibility to  report adverse reactions (for which they suspec t a causal role of a medicine) to the marketing  authorisation holder of the suspected medicinal product (studied or not) or to the concerned competent  authorities authorit y via the national spontaneous reporting system  (s. ee summary in Table  VI.1.).ValidThe resulting v alid ICSRs should be managed, classified and reported submitted  as  spontaneous (see VI.C.6.2.3.7 . subsection 2 ) by the receiver of the reports .notified competent  autho rity or marketing authorisation holder  (see VI.6.2.3.7 Subsection 2   for guidance on the   electronic submission of these ICSRs ).

Local  requirements  should be followed as applicable.   Where an organisation41 or a healthcare professional, supplying a medicinal product under  compassion ate use or named patient use , is notified or becomes aware of a n adverse event , it should  be managed  as follow s depending on  the requirements  in the concerned Member State :   ï· For compassionate  use and named patient use conducted in Member States (or in countries outside  the EU) where the active collection of adverse events occurring in the se programmes is required ,  the reports of adverse reactions , which are  suspected to be related to the supplied medicinal  product  by the primary source or the receiver of the case notified organisation , should be  reported .submitted  as ICSRs  in line with the time frames and modalities  provided in VI.C.3.  and  VI.C.4. . They should be considered as solicited reports  (see see VI.C.2.2.2 . and VI.6.2.3.7  Subsection 1  for guidance on the  electronic submission of these ICSRs ).   ï· For compassionate use and named patient use  conducted in Member States  (or in countries outside  the EU) where the active collectio n of adverse events occurring in these programmes is not  required , any notified noxious or unintended response to the  supplied  medicinal product  should be  reported. submitted as ICSR  in accordance with the time frames and modalities  provided in VI.C.3.   and VI.C.4. . It should be considered as a spontaneous report of suspected adverse reaction . (see  see VI.6.2.3.7 Subsection 2  for guida nce on the  electronic submission of these ICSRs VI.C.6.2.3.7.   subsection 2 ).   VI.C.2. Colle ction of reports   VI.C.2.1. Responsibi lities of Member State s  Each M ember State sh all have in place a system for the coll ection and recording of unsolicited and  solicited  reports  of suspected adverse reactions  that occur in its territory  and which are brought to its  attention by healthcare professionals, consumers , or marketing authorisation holder s42 [DIR Art 101(1)  and 107a (1)]. In this context, the competent authorit iesy in a Member State s  shall establish  procedures for collecting and recording all  reports of  suspected adverse reactions that occur in their its  territory  [IR Art 15  (2)]. T he definitions and general  principl es detailed in  VI.A.1.  and Section  VI.B,.,  together with the time frames and reporting modalities presented in VI.C.3., VI.C.4. and VI.C.6 . should  be applied  with regard  to their submission as ICSRs  to the EudraVigilance database  should be applied  to those reports . should be applied  to those reports .   Member States shall involve patients and healthcare professionals, as appropriate, in the follow -up of  any reports they receivein order to comply with Article 102(c) and (e) [DIR Art 107a(1)].  Furthermore,  for reports submitted by a marketing authorisation holder, Member States on whose territory the  suspected adverse reaction occurred may involve the marketing authorisation holder in the follow -up  of the reports  [DIR Art 107 a(2)]. In support of the operation of these follow -up procedures, business                                                   41 E.g. sponsor, applicant, marketing authorisation holder, hospital or wholesaler.   42 The Mmarketing authorisation holders shall report submit ICSRs to EudraVigilance the competent authorities in Member  States  in accordance with the transitional  provisions set out in Art icle icle 2(4)107(3)  of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article  2(5) of Directive 2010/84/EU and further detailed in VI.C.4 .1.

The criteria upon  which competent authorities in Member States may involve a marketing authorisation  holder in the  follow -up of individual cases refer to the need to seek clarifications on inconsistent data in ICSRs, but  also to the  need to obtain further information in the context of the validation of a signal, the evaluation  of a safety issue, the asse ssment of a periodic safety update report or the confirmation of a safety  concern  in a risk management plan. Further  guidance on the follow -up of ICSRs  is provided in VI.B.3. .  Pharmacovigilance data and documents r elating to individual authorised medicinal products shall be  retained as long as the product is authorised and for at least 10 years after the marketing  authorisation has expired. However, the documents shall be retained for a longer period where Union  law or national law so requires  [IR Art 16 (2)].   Each Member State shall take all appropriate  measures to encourage healthcare professionals and  consumers in their territory to report suspected adverse reactions to their competent authority. In  addition , the competent authority in a Member State may impose specific obligations on healthcare  professionals.  To this end, the competent authorit iesy in a Member State s shall facilitate in theirits  territory the reporting of suspected adverse reactions by mean s of alternative straightforward  reporting systems, accessible to healthcare professionals and consumers, in addition to web -based  formats  [DIR Art 102] . Information on the different ways of reporting suspected adverse reactions  related to medicinal products , shall be made publicly available , including by means of national  medicines web -based portals [DIR 106(e)]. To increase awar eness of the reporting systems,  organisations representing consumers and healthcare professionals may be involved  as appropriate  [DIR Ar t 102] .   Standard In line with Art icleicle 25 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 ,  standard  web-based structured forms for the reporting of suspected adverse reactions by healthcare  professionals and consumers shall be have been  developed by the Agency Member States  in  collaboration with Member States the Agency  in order to collect across the EU harmonised information  relevant for the evaluation of suspected adverse reactions , including errors associated with the use of  medicinal produ cts [REG Art 25] . In this context, core data fields  for reporting  will be made available  by the Agency to the competent authorities in Member States for use in their national reporting  systems as applicable ..   The reports of suspected adverse reactions rec eived from healthcare professionals and consumers  should be acknowledged where appropriate  and further information should be provided to the reporters  as requested  and when available .   Member States shall involve patients and healthcare professionals, as a ppropriate, in the follow -up of  any reports they receive in order to comply with Art icle 102(c) and (e) of Directive 2001/83/EC   [DIR  Art 107a(1)]. Furthermore, for reports submitted by a marketing authorisation holder, Member States  on whose territory the  suspected adverse reaction occurred may involve the marketing authorisation  holder in the follow -up of the reports [DIR Art 107a(2)]. The criteri a upon which a marketing  authorisation holder may be involved include situations where :  ï· important additional i nformation is necessary for case evaluation or reconciliation,   ï· clarifications is needed regarding inconsistent data within ICSRs,   ï· there is a need to obtain further information in the context of the validation of a signal, the  evaluation of a safety issue , the assessment of a periodic safety update report , or the confirmation  of a safety concern in a risk management plan.

Therefore,  where reports of suspected adverse reactions are sent directly to other authorities, bodies,  organisations and/or institutions  within a Member Stat e, the competent authority in that Member State  shall have data exchange agreements in place so that these reports are brought to its attention and  are made available to Eudra Vigilance in a timely manner [DIR Art  107a(5) ]. This applies as well to  reports of  suspected adverse reactions arising from an error associated with the use of a medicinal  product. Those error reports of suspected adverse reactions for which  a competent authority in a  Member State  is made aware of, including those received from the Eudr aVigilance database in  accordance with Article 24(4) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 , shall also be brought to the attention  of other authorities, bodies, organisations and/or institutions responsible for patient safety within that  Member State  [DIR Art 107 a(5)]. within that Member State . These reports shall be appropriately  identified in the standard web -based structured forms  referred to in Art icle 25 of Regulation (EC) No  726/2004 , developed  for the reporting of suspected adverse reactions by healthcare professionals and  patients [DIR Art 107a(5)] . To facilitate such reporting, it may be necessary to implement data  exchange agreements or other arrangements, as appropriate . Further guidance concerning the  management and assessment  of reports of medication errors is provided in the Good Practice Guide on  Recording, Coding, Reporting and Assessment of Medication Errors43.  Pharmacovigilance data and documents relating to individual authorised medicinal products shall be  retained  by the national competent authorities in Member States and the Agency  as long as the  product is authorised and for at least 10 years after the marke ting authorisation has expired. However,  the documents shall be retained for a longer period where Union law or national law so requires  [IR Art  16(2)]  (see VI.C.6.2.4.  and GVP Module I  for guidance  on ICSRs data quality ).   Unless there are justifiable grounds resulting from pharmacovigilance activities, individual Membe r  States shall not impose any additional obligations on marketing authorisation holders for the reporting  of suspected adverse reactions  [DIR Art 107a(6) ].  VI.C.2. 2. Responsibilities of the m arketing a uthorisation holder  in the EU    Each m arketing authorisa tion holder shall have in place a system for the collection and recording of all  reports of suspected adverse reactions in the EU or in third countries  which are brought to its                                                   43 Ref.: EMA/762563/2014 ; EMA website: Home/ Human regulatory/ Post -authorisation/ Pharmacovigilance/ Medication  errors      Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 40/225     attention , whether reported spontaneously by healthcare professionals or consum ers or occurring in  the context of a post -authorisation study [DIR A rt 104(1), Art  107(1)].    The Mmarketing authorisation holder s shall establish procedures in order to obtain accurate and  verifiable data for the scientific evaluation of suspected adverse reaction reports  [Dir Art 107(4)] . They  shall not refuse to consider reports of suspected adverse reactions received electronically or by  any other appropriate means from patients and healthcare professionals [ DIR Art 107(2)].   The m All those r eports shall  be accessible at a single point within the Union [Dir Art 107(1)]. All  these reports of suspected adverse reactions shall be accessible at a single point within the Union [Dir  Art 107(1)] . Marketing authorisation holder s shall establish procedures in order  to obtain accurate and  verifiable data for the scientific evaluation of suspected adverse reaction reports  [Dir Art 107(4)] . They  shall also collect follow -up information on these reports and submit the updates to the Eudra vVigilance  database [Dir Art 107 (4)]. The In support of the operation of the follow -up procedures, a business  process map  and a process description are  provided in VI.App .1.1. General  guidance on the follow ing- up of reports of suspected adver se reactions is provided in VI.B.3. . Mmarketing authorisation holder s  shall establish mechanisms enabling the traceability and follow -up of adverse reaction reports while  complying with the data protection legislat ion [IR Art 12 (1)]. In support of the operation of the follow - up procedures, business process map s and process description s are provided in VI.App.1.1.   and  VI.App .1.2.. Further  guidance on the follow -up of ICSRs  is provided in VI.B.3.  and in VI.C.6.2.2.7. .   For the ICSRs  made accessible  to a marketing authorisation hold er from the EudraVigilance database  in accordance with Art icle 24(2)  of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  and in line with the EudraVigilance  Access Policy for Medicines for Human Use44, the routine request for follow -up by the marketing  authorisation holder  is not foreseen . If the follow -up of an ICSR is necessary for a specific  situation , a  justification should b e provided with the request , which should be addressed directly to the sender  organisation of the ICSR .  Pharmacovigilance data and documents relating to  individual authorised medicinal products shall be  retained by the marketing authorisation holder as long as the product is authorised and for at least 10  years after the marketing authorisation has ceased to exist. However, the documents shall be retained   for a longer period where Union law or national law so requires  [IR Art 12 (2)] (see VI.C.6.2.4.  and  GVP Module I  for guidance  on ICSRs data quality ).  With regard to the collection and recording of reports of suspected adverse reactions , the marketing  authorisation holder s responsibilities apply to reports related to me dicinal products (see ) for which  ownership cannot be excluded on  the basis of one the following criteria : medicinal product name,  active substance name, pharmaceutical form,  batch number  or route of administration  (see also the  introduction to  Section  VI.C. for the type of medicinal products concerned  by EU requirements ).  Exclusion based on the primary source count ry or country of origin of the adverse reaction  is possible  if  the marketing authorisation holder  can dem onstrate that the suspected medicinal product has never  been supplied or placed on the market in that territory or that  the product is not a travel medicine   (e.g., anti-malarial medicinal product) .   The m arketing authorisation holder shall  ensure that any information on  adverse reactions , suspected  to be related to  at least one of the active substance s of its medicinal products authorised in the EU , is  brought to its attention by  any company  outside the EU  belonging to the same mother company (or  group of c ompanies ) 45. The same applies to the marketing authorisation holder when having  concluded a commercial agreement with a company outside the E U for one of its medicinal product                                                   44 EMA website: Home/ Human regulatory/ Post -authorisation/ Pharmacovigilance/ EudraVigilance/ Access to data   45 As outlined in the Commission Communication on the Co mmunity Marketing Authorization Procedures for Medicinal  Products (Ref.: (98/C 229/03 ).

Pursuant to Dir Article 107(1)  of Directive 2001/83/EC , the marketing  authorisation holder shall record those reports of suspected adverse reactions  and shall also be ensure  that they  are accessible at a single point within the EU. The source data or an image should be easily  accessible in order to be made availa ble to competent authorities in Member States upon request (see  VI.B.5.  for guidance on quality management ). The clock for reporting the submission  (see VI.B.7. for  day zero definition ) starts when a valid ICSR is first received by one of these companies  outside the  EU.   In addition to the requirements presented in this Section chapter , the definitions and general principles  detailed in VI.A.1.  and Section VI.B., together with the time frames and reporting modalities presented  in VI.C.3 ., VI.C.4 . and VI.C.6 . should be applied by the marketing authorisation holder s to all reports  of suspected adverse reactions.   VI.C.2.2.1. Spontaneous reports   The m Marketing authorisation holder s shall record all reports of s uspected adverse reactions  originating from within or outside the EU, which are brought to their its attention spontaneously by  healthcare professionals , or consumers . This includes  reports of suspected adverse reactions received  electronically or by any o ther appropriate means  [DIR Art 107(1), Art 107 (2)]. In this context, the  marketing authorisation holder s may consider utilising theirits websites to facilitate the collection of  reports of suspected adverse reaction s by providing adverse reaction s forms f or reporting , or  appropriate contact details for direct communication  (see VI.B.1.1.4 . for guidance on ICSRs  management from the internet or digital media ).  VI.C.2.2.2. Solicited reports   In accordance with Article 107(1)  of Directive 2001/83/EC  of Directive 2001/83/EC , the marketing  authorisation holder s shall record all reports of suspected adverse reactions originating from within or  outside the EU, which occur in post -authorisation studies , initiated, manage d, or financed  by that  organisation em46.  For non -interventional post -authorisation studies, th is requirement  applies to study  designs based on primary data collection  and the guidance provided in VI.C.1.2.1. 1. should be  followed.   For all solicited reports  (see VI.B.1.2.  for definition ), the marketing authorisation holder s should have  mechanisms in place to record and document complete  and comprehensive  case informa tion and to  evaluate that information , in order to allow the meaningful assessment of individual cases and  reporting the submission  of valid ICSRs  (see VI.B.2 . for ICSRs validation ) related to the studied (or  supplied) medicinal  product . MThe m arketing authorisation holder s should therefore exercise  due  diligence in establishing such system , in following -up those reports  (see VI.B.3 . for follow -up guidance )  and in seeking  the view of the primary source as regard s the causal role of the studied (or supplied)  medicinal product  on the notified adverse event . Where  this opinion is missing , the marketing  authorisation holder should exercise its own judgement  to perform a causal ity assessment based on  the information available in orde r to decide whether the report is a valid ICSR, which should be  reported submitted  in accordance with the  time frames and modalities presented in VI.C.3. , VI.C.4.  and  VI.C.6 .to the competent authorities . This requirement does not apply to study designs based on  secondary use of data  since reporting the submission of ICSRs is not re quired ( see VI.C.1.2.1 .2. for  guidance on this type of studies VI.C.1.2.1 .).

With regard s to the screening  of the scientific and medical l iterature medical literature , the  requirements provided in this Module are part of  the marketing authorisation holder obligations  reporting in relation to (i) the submission  of individual cases of suspected adverse reactions , as well as  and to  (ii) the wider  literature searches which need to be conducted for periodic safety update reports  (see GVP Module VII ).  VI.C. 2.2.3. 1 Monitoring of the medical literature medical literature  by the European  Medicines Agency   In line with Art icle 27 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 , Tthe Agency shall monitor s selected medical  literature for reports of suspected adverse reactions to med icinal products containing certain active  substances. It shall publish es a list of active substances being monitored and the medical literature  subject to this monitoring . The Agency shall enter s into the EudraVigilance database relevant  information from t he selected medical literature . The Agency  shall, in consultation with the European  Commission, Member States and interested parties, draw s up a detailed guide regarding the  monitoring of medical literature and the entry of relevant information into the Eu draVigilance database   [REG Art 27] .  The medical literature and the active substances subject to the monitoring by the Agency are published  aton a dedicated webpage47 of the Agencyâs website  together with supporting documents . Further  information  is also provided in the  Detailed Guide Regarding the Monitoring of Medical Literature and  the Entry of Relevant Information into the EudraVigilance Database by the European Medicines  Agency48, , which defines the different steps of the medical literature monitoring (M LM) business  processes.    ICSRs resulting from the MLM service performed by the Agency can be accessed from the  EudraVigilance  database by the marketing authorisation holder concerned . They are also made  available for download in XML format . This refers to ICSRs of serious  suspected adverse reactions   occurring within and outside the E U, and to ICSRs of non-serious suspected adverse reactions  from  within the E U.   In accordance with Articleicle 107(3)  of Directive 2001/83/EC  of Directive 2001/83/EC , in order  and to  avoid the reporting submission  of duplicate ICSR s, the marketing authorisation holder s shall only  report submit  those ICSRs described  in the scientific and medical literature medical literature  which is  not reviewed by the Agency , for all medicinal pr oducts containing active substances which are not  included in the list monitored  by the Agency pursuant to Articleicle 27 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004   of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 .                                                    47 EMA website: Home/ Human regulatory/ Post -authorisati on/ Pharmacovigilance/ Medical literature monitoring   Monitoring  of medical literature and entry of adverse reaction rep orts into EudraVigilance    48 Ref.: (Doc Ref.

Appendix  2.   Articles can be excluded from the reporting of ICSRs by the marketing authorisation holder if anothe r  company's branded medicinal product is the suspected medicinal product. In the absence of a specified  medicinal product source and/or invented name, ownership of the medicinal product should be  assumed for arti cles about an active substance , unless alternative reasons  for exclusion  detailed  hereafter  apply :  VI.C.2.2.3.2 Exclusion criteria for the reporting submission  of ICSRs published in the  scientific literature medical literature   The following exclusion criteria for the submission of ICSRs reporting  to the EudraVigilance database  by a marketing authorisation holder s may be applyied for individual cases published in the scientific  literature medical literature :   a. where ownership of the suspected medicinal product by the marketing authorisation holder can be  excluded on the basis of the criteria detailed  in VI.C.2.2 .; medicinal product name, active  substance name, pharmaceutical form, batch number  or route of administration ;   b. for individual case safety re ports identified in the scientific and medical literature that  originate which originate s in a country where a company holds a marketing authorisation but has  never commercialised the medicinal product ;  c. for literature ICSRs  which areis based on an analysis from a competent authority database within   the EU. TheHowever , the reporting submission  requirements remain for th ose ICSRs which are  based on the analysis from a competent authority database outside the EU ;  d. for literature articles,  which present present s aggregated  data analyses  or line listings refers to data   from publicly available databases  or, (e.g. poison control centres ), and where  the cases are  presented in aggregate tables or line listings . The submission requirement remain s for valid cases   described  individually ;   e. which summarise summarise spresents  the results from post -authorisation studies , meta -analyses ,   (see VI.C.1.2.). This type of literature article or literature reviews ,;   f. which describes  suspecte d adverse reactions , which occur  in a group of patients with a designated  medicinal product  with the aim of and theindividual  patient s cannot be identified  individually for  creating valid case report sICSRs  (see VI.B.2. for ICSRs validation) .   For points d to f, t his type of literature aim s at identifying or quantifying a safety hazard related to a  medicinal product , and aggregated  data on patients are often  presented in tables or line listings .. The  main objective  of those studies  is to detect/evaluate specific risks that could affect the overall risk- benefit balance of a medicinal product.    New and significant safety findings presented in these articles , for which reporting the submission of  ICSRs is not required , should however be discussed in the relevant sections of the concerned periodic  safety update report (see GVP Module VII ) and analysed as regards their overall impact on the  medicinal product risk-benefit profile. In addition, any new safety information, which may impact on  the risk-benefit profile of a medicinal product, should be notified immediate ly to the competent  authorities in Member States where the medicinal product is authorised and to the Agency in  accordance with the recommendations guidance  provided in VI.C.2.2.6 ..     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 44/225     A detailed guidance on the mon itoring of the scientific and medical literature has been d eveloped  in  accordance with Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 ; it is included in VI. Appendix  2.   The electronic reporting recommendation s regarding suspected adverse reactions reports published in  the scientific and medical  literature are provided in VI.C.6.2.3.2 ..  VI.C.2.2.4. Suspected adverse rea ctions related to quality def ect or falsified medicinal  products   When a report of suspected adverse reactions is associated with a suspected or confirmed  falsified  medicinal product49 or(see GVP Annex I ) or with a quality defect of a medicinal product, a valid ICSR   should be reported submitted . The seriousness of the ICSR is linked to the seriousness of the reported  suspected adverse reactions in accor dance with the definitions provided in VI.A.2.4 VI.A.2.4 VI.A.1.6..  The guidance on the eElectronic reporting submission  recommendations of ICSRs provided in  VI.C.6.2.3. 5. should be followed.   In addition i n order to protect public health, it may become necessary to implement urgent measures  such as the recall of one or more def ective batch(es) of a medicinal product from the market.  Therefore, the marketing authorisation holders should have a system in place to ensure that reports of  suspected adverse reactions related to falsified medicinal products or to quality defects of a m edicinal  products are investigated in a timely fashion and that confirmed quality defects are notified separately  to the manufacturer and to the competent authorities in Member States in accordance with the  provisions described in Article 13 of Directive 2003/94/EC .  VI.C.2.2.5. Suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent   For the purposes of reporting, Aany suspected transmission of an in fectious agent via a medicinal  product (including vaccines) should be considered as a serious adverse reaction and such case s should  be reported submitted  within 15 days  in accordance with the requirements outlined in VI.C.4 . and the  electronic submission guidance  detailed in VI.C.6.2.3.6.  50. If no other criterion is applicable , the  seriousness of this ICSR should be considered as important m edical event (s ee VI.A.2.4 VI.A.1.6.  for  seriousness definition ). This also applies to vaccines . Electronic  reporting recommendations provided in  VI.C.6.2.3.6 .VI.C.6.2.3.6.  should be followed.    In the case of medicinal products derived from human blood or human plasma, haemovigilance  procedures may also apply in accordance with Directive 2002/98/EC Directive 2002/98/EC . Therefore   the marketing authorisation holder  should have a system in place to communicate any suspected  transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal prod uct of an infectious agent to the manufacturer,  the relevant blood establishment(s) and national competent authorit ies in Member States .  Any organism, virus or infectious particle (e.g. prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform  encephalopathy), p athogenic or non -pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent.   A transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical signs or symptoms, or laboratory  findings indicating an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.   Emphasis sh ould be on the detection of infections/infectious agents known to be potentially  transmitted via a medicinal product, but the occurrence of unknown agents should also always be  considered .                                                    49 see GVP Annex I  and EMA webp age on falsified medicines : Home/ Human regulatory/ Overview/ Public health threats/  Falsified medicines   50 See VI.C.6.2.3.6 . for electronic reporting submission recommendations  of ICSRs .

Confirmation of contamination (including inadequate inactivation/attenuation of infectious agents as  active substances) of the concerned medicinal product increases the evidence for transmission of an  infectious  agent  and may therefore be suggestive of a quality defect  for which the procedures detailed  in VI.C.2.2. 4. should be applied .   Medicinal products should comply with the recommendations provided in the Note for Guidance on  Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Sp ongiform Encephalopathy Agents v ia Human and  Veterinary Products51. For advanced therapy medicinal products, Article 14 (5) of Regulation (EC) No  1394/2007  and the Guideline on Safety and Efficacy Follow -up - Risk Management of Advanced  Therapy Medicinal Products52, should also be followed as appropriate .  VI.C.2.2.6. Emerging safety issues   Event s/observations  may occur  in relation to an authorised medicinal product , which do not fall within  the definition of reportable valid ICSRs , and thus are not subject to the reporting requirements , even  though they may lead to changes  in may have major impac ts on the known risk-benefit balance ofof  the  a medicinal  product  and/or impact on patient s or public health .. Examples include :  major safety findings from a newly completed non -clinical study;   major safety concerns identified in the course of a non-interventional post-authorisation study or of a  clinical trial;   signal of a possible teratogen  effect or of significant hazard to public health;   safety issues publis hed in the scientific and medical  literature;   safety issues arising from the signal detection ac tivity (see Module IX) or emerging from a new ICSR   and which impact on the risk -benefit balance of the medicin al product  and/or have implications for  public health ;  safety issues related to the use outside the terms of the marketing authorisation;   safety issues due to misinformation in the product information;   marketing authorisation withdrawal, non -renewal, revoc ation or suspension outside the EU for safety - related reasons;   urgent safety restrictions outside the EU ;  safety issues  in relation to the supply of ra w material;   lack of supply of medicines .  These events/observations , which may affect the risk -benefit bal ance of a medicinal product , are not to  be submitted as ICSRs. They should be  notified  as emerging safety issues in writing to the competent  authorities in Member States where the medicinal product is authorised and to the Agency  via email                                                   51 Latest revision .

They  These important new evidences  should be  notified considered  as emerging safety issues  (see GVP  Annex I ). They should be notified to the competent authorities and the Agency  in accordance with the  requirements provided in GVP Module IX . This is in addition to the ICSR submission requirements  detailed in VI.C.3 . and VI.C.4., when the emerging safety issue refers to a single case of suspected  adverse reactions (see VI.C.6.2.2.1.  for general guidance on ICSRs preparation ).  VI.C.2.2 .7. Period between the submission of the marketing authorisation application and  the granting of the marketing authorisation   In the period between the submission of the marketing authorisation application and the granting of  the marketing authorisation , information  (quality, non -clinical , clinical ) that could impact on the risk- benefit balance  of the medicinal product under evaluation  may b ecome available to the applicant53. It  is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that this information is immedia tely submitted  in  accordance with the modalities described in VI.C.2.2. 6. to the competent authorities in the Me mber  States where the application is under assessment (including Reference Member State and all  concerned Member States for products assessed under the mutual recognition or decentralised  procedures)  and to the Agency . For appl ications  under the centralised procedure , the information  should  also be provided to the (Co-) Rapporteur.   In the situation whe re a medicinal product application is under evaluation in the EU while it has already  been authorised in a third country, v alid ICSRs from outside the EU , originating from unsolicited  reports (see VI.B.1.1 . for definition ) or solicited reports (s ee VI.B.1.2 . for definition ), should be  reported submitted  in accordance with the time frames and modalities requirements  provided in VI.C.3.,  VI.C.4 . and VI.C.6 ..   VI.C.2.2.8. Period after suspension, revocation or withdrawal of marketing authorisation   The marketing authorisation holder  shall continue to collect any  reports of  suspected adverse reaction s  related to the concerned medicinal product following the suspension of a marketing authorisation. The  time frames and reporting submission requirements outline d in VI.C.3., VI.C.4 . and VI.C.6. remain  for  valid ICSRs .  Where a marketing authorisation is withdrawn or revoked, the former marketing authorisation holder  is  encouraged to continue  to collect spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions originating  within the EU to, for example , facilitate the review of delayed onset adverse reactions or of  retrospectively notified cases.   VI.C.2.2.9. Period during a public health emergency   A public health emergency is a public health threat duly recognised either by the World Health  Organization (WHO) or the Community in the framework of Decision No. 2119/98/EC Decision No.  2119/98/EC  as amended  of the European Parliament and of the Council.

Reports from class action law suits   Stimulated r eport s arising from class action law suits should be managed  as spontaneous  reports. Valid  ICSRs  should  describe  suspected adverse reactions related to the concerned  medicinal product. They   should be reported submitted  in accordance with the time frames and modalities described in VI.C.3 .,  VI.C.4 . and VI.C.6 ..  Where large batches of potential ICSRs are received, the marketing authorisation holder s may request ,  in exceptional circumstances , for an exemption in order to submit serious cases of suspected adve rse  reactions within 30 days from their date of receipt instead of 15 days. The 90 days reporting  submission  time frame for non -serious ICSRs remains unchanged. It will be possible to apply for this  exemption  only once the functionalities of the EudraVigil ance database specified in Article 24(2)  of  Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  are established. The request should be made to the Agency âs  pharmacovigilance department .  VI.C.2.2.1 1. Reports from p atient support programme s and market research programme s  A patient support programme is an organised system  where a marketing authorisation holder receives   and collect s information relating to the use of its medicinal product s. Examples are post -authorisation  patient support and disease management programmes, surveys of p atients and healthcare  providers professionals , information gathering on patient compliance, or compensation/re -imbursement  schemes.   A market research programme refers to  the systematic collection, recording and analysis by a  marketing authorisation holder  of data and findings  about its medicinal products , relevant for  marketing and business development.   Safety reports originating from those programmes should be considered as solicited reports. The  mMarketing authorisation holder s should have the same mecha nisms in place as for  all other  solicited  reports  (see VI.C.2.2.2 . for marketing authorisation holders responsibilities on solicited reports ) to  manage that information  and report to submit , in line with the time fr ames and modalities  outlined in  VI.C.3.  and VI.C.4. , valid cases of adverse reactions , which are suspected to be related to  the  concerned medicinal product .  Valid ICSRs  should be reported submitted  as solicited  in accordance with the electronic reporting  requirements guidance  provided in  VI.6.2.3.7 Subsection 1 .  VI.C.2.2.12. Report ing of off -label use   The off -label use of a medicina l product may occur for various reasons  (see definition in VI.A.1.2. and  GVP Annex I ). Examples  include the intentional use of a product in situation s other than the one s  described in the authorised product information , such as :  ï· a different indication in term of medical condition;   ï· a different group of patients;   ï· a different rou te or method of administration ;  ï· a different posology.      Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 48/225     With r egard  to the management of  individual reports referring to  the off-label use  of a product , the  responsibilities  of the marketing authorisation holder  can be  summarised as follows , depending if the  off-label use  results in the patientâ s harm:  a. The o ff-label use of a medicinal produc t results in patient âs harm with occurrence of a  suspected adverse reaction   In line with Article 107(1) , 107(3)  and 107(4)  of Directive 2001/83/EC , the marketing  authorisation holder shall collect individual reports of suspected adverse reactions when becoming  aware of them.  The reports  shall be routinely followed -up to ensure that the information is as  complete as possible  (see VI.C.2.2.  for marketing authorisation holdersâ  responsibilities  on ICSRs ).  Valid ICSRs shall be  submitted  to the EudraVigilance  database  in accordance with the time frames ,  and modalities provided  in VI.C.3. , VI.C.4. , and VI.C.6.2.3.3 .   Where relevant and appropriate,  the benefit -risk analysis evaluation presented in the periodic  safety update report should take into account the clinical importance of a risk in relation to the  off-label use of the concerned medicinal product  (see GVP Module VII ).   In line with the guidance provided in GVP Module V,  where there is a scientific  rationale that an  adverse clinical outcome might be associated with the off-label use  of the product , the adverse  reaction should be considered a potential risk, and if deemed important, should be included in the  list of safety concerns of the risk manage ment plan as an important potential risk. This is  particularly  relevant , when differences in safety concerns between the target and the off -label  population are anticipated . Important potential risks included in the risk management plan would  usually requi re further evaluation as part of the pharmacovigilance plan.   b. The o ff-label use of a medicinal product  does not result in patient âs harm  and occurrence  of a suspected adverse reaction   The potential obligations regarding the collection of data on the  off-label use o f a medicinal  product  are set out in Art icle 23(2)  of Directive 2001/83/EC , which requires the marketing  authorisation holder to report to competent authorities  in Member States any other new  information which might  influence the evaluation  of the benefits  and risks of the medicinal  product , including data on the use of the product where such use is outside the terms of the  marketing authorisation.   Under this condition , the most appropriate way to deliver a planned and risk proportionate  approac h to enable the monitoring of the use of a specific medicinal product in routine clinical  settings is through the  risk management plan.  Where the potential for off -label use has been  identified for a product  and such use could  raise a safety concern  (i.e. because  there is a justified  supposition that an important  potential risk might be associated with the off -label use of the  product ) the risk management plan should discuss  the need of pharmacovigilance activities  in  terms of :  - Specific follow -up questionna ires for suspected adverse reactions derived from the  off-label use ;  - Other required forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities for the targeted  collection and follow -up of individual reports  of off-label use not associated with  suspected adverse reactio ns;   - Additional structured investigations (such as drug utilisation studies, searches in  databases).      Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 49/225     If collected  in the frame of the  routine pharmacovigilance activities , individual reports of off -label  use with no suspected adver se reaction  should not b e submitted  to the EudraVigilance  database  since the min imum criteria for ICSRs validation are incomplete ( see VI.B.2.  for ICSRs validation ).  As part of risk management planning, the monitoring of the off-label u se should focus on  collection and assessment of information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and  risks of the concerned medicinal product.   For products without a risk management plan, the marketing authorisation holder  and the  competent  authorit y should consider whether the off-label use of the product constitutes a safety  concern. If it does, then consideration should be given to requiring a risk management plan or a  post-authorisation safety study.  Some M ember States may already have p ut in place specific requirements  at national level regarding  the collection and submission  by marketing authorisation holders  of information on the off-label use of  their products . The guidance  presented in this chapter  should not be interpreted as preven ting the  fulfilment of those local obligations.   VI.C.3. Reporting Submission  time frames  of ICSRs in EU   The g eneral rules in relation to  the reporting  submission  of initial and follow -up reports , including those  for defining the clock start are detailed in  VI.B.7..  According to Articleicles 107(3) and 107a(4)  of Directive 2001/83/EC  of Directive 2001/83/EC ,   ï· serious valid ICSRs shall be reported submitted  by the competent authorit iesy in a Member States  or by the marketing authorisation holder s within 15 days from the  date of receipt of the reports;   ï· non-serious valid ICSRs shall be reported submitted  by the competent authorit iesy in a Member  States or by the marketing authorisation holder s within 90 days from the da te of receipt of the  reports .   This should be done in accordance with the reporting modalities detailed in VI.C.4 ..  ICH-E2B provides a mechanism to the sender to indicate whether a valid ICSR the case fulfils the local  expedited regulatory  requirements  for submission  to the EudraVigilance database  within the 15 or 90- day time frame . In line with ICH -E2B the following applies  for allthe  serious and non -serious ICSRs  which need  to be submitted reportable in the EU based on the modalities detailed in VI.C.4. :  Reference  E2B(R2)/(R3) requirements   ICH-E2B(R2)  ï· Data element A.1.9 â Does this case fulfil the local criteria for an expedited report?â   should be  completed  with the value  1 (YES)  when the ICSR needs  to be submitted  within the 15 or 90 -day time frame .   ï· The population of this data element is optional under ICH-E2B(R2) .  ICH-E2B(R3)  ï· Data element C.1.7 âDoes this Case fulfil the local criteria for an expedited r eport?â  should be completed  with the value TRUE  when the ICSR needs  to be submitted  within the 15 or 90 -day time frame .   ï· The population of this data element is mandatory under ICH-E2B(R 3).

ICSRs shall be used for reporting the  submission  to the Eudrav igilance Eudra Vigilance database of reports of suspected adverse reactions to  a medicinal product that occur in a single patient at a specific point in time  [IR Art 27 ]. The  cCompetent authorities authorit y in a Member State s and the marketing authorisatio n holder s shall  also ensure that all  reported submitted  electronic ICSRs are well documented and as complete as  possible in accordance with the requirements provided in [IR Article 28 of the Commission  Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012 ].   The time fr ames for reporting submitting serious and non -serious valid ICSRs are provided in VI.C.3 ..  The recommendations guidance  provided in  VI.C.6. should be adhere d to as regards the e lectronic  exchange of pharmacovigilance information between competent authorities in Member States,  marketing authorisation holders  and the Agency.   ICSRs reported  electronically  to the EudraVigilance database  will be made accessible to stakeholders  such as  competent authorities , healthcare professionals,  consumers, as well as marketing authorisation  holders  and research organisations in accordance with Article 24(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004   and the EudraVigilance Access Policy for Medicines for Human Use54. This policy defines the overall  principles of the provision of access to EudraVigilance data in line with the current legal framework,  while guaranteeing personal data protection.  As detailed in  the EudraVigilance access policy , a  selection of ICSRs could be downloaded by marketing authorisation holders in ICH E2B format and in  accordance with the ICH M2 message specifications , to facilitate their pharmacovigilance activities .  VI.C.4.1. Interim  arrangement s  In accordance line with the provisions set o ut in Article 2(4), Article 2(5)  and Article 2(6)  of Directive  2010/84/ EU, until the Agency can ensure the functionalities of the EudraVigilance database as  specified in Article 24(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 , Article 107(3) and 107a(4)  of Directive  2001/83/EC  of Directive 2001/83/EC , the following reporting submission  requirements shall apply to  valid unsolicited and solicited ICSRs  reported by healthcare professional s and non -healthcare  professional s.

Howe ver, the  complete information  (medical and administrative data) for a valid  ICSR that is available to the sender  should be reported submitted  in a struct ured mann er in the relevant ICH -E2B(R2) data elements  (see  GVP Annex IV ) (which should be repeated as necessary  when multiple  information is available ) and in  the narrative section for serious cases (see VI.C.6.2.2.4 . for gu idance on case narrative ). This applies  to all types of ICSRs, such as  reports with initial information on the case, follow -up information  and  cases highlighted for amendment68 or nullification69.   In the situation where it is evident that the sender has not  transmitted the complete information  available on the case , the receiver may request the sender to re -transmit the ICSR within 24 hours  with the complete case information in electronic format in accordance with the requirements applicable  for the electron ic reporting submission  of ICSRs. This should be seen in the light of the qualitative  signal detection and evaluation  activity , where it is important for the receiver to have all the available  information on a case to perform the medical assessment  (see VI.C.6.2.4 . for guidance  on ICSRs data  quality ).  Where the suspected adverse reaction s reported in a single  ICSR have a major impact on the known  risk-benefit balance of a the medicinal product, this should be conside red as  an emerging safety issue  and notified accordingly (see VI.C.2.2. 6. and GVP Module IX  for guidance on emerging safety issue ).,  which  should be immediately notified in writing  to the competent authorities of the Member States  where the medicinal product is authorised and to the Agency.

Follow -up information   In addition to the guidance general principles provided  in VI.B.3. , the following guidance should be  followed  concerning the management of follow -up information on ICSRs .:    ICSRs are sent at different times to multiple receiver s. Therefore the initial/follow -up status status  for  a report is dependent  upon the receiver. For this reason an item to capture follow -up status is not  included in the ICH-E2B(R2) data elements. . However, the data element  âDatedate of receipt of the  most recent information for this reportâ (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.7) report taken together with the data  element  âSender identifierâ (ICH E2B(R2)  A.3.1.2)  and the data element âS enderâs senderâs  (case) report  unique identifierâ (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.0.1) identifie worldwide unique case identification number and the  senderâs identifier r provide a mechanism for each receiver to identify  whether the report being  transmitted is an initial or a follow -up report. For this reason t These items are  therefore considered   critical for each transmission submission  and a precise date should always be used (i.e. day, month,  year).    In this context , tThe data element âDate date of receipt of the most recent information for this reportâ  (ICH-E2B(R2) A.1.7)  report should therefore always be updated  each time a a follow -up information is  received by a competent authority or a marketing authorisation holder , independently irrespective   whether the follow -up information received is significant enough to be reported submitted . The  worldwide unique case identification number  of the initial ICSR should be maintained and The the data  element âDate date the report was first received from the a sourceâ (ICH-E2B(R2) A.1. 6)source   reporter should remain unchanged to the date the  competent authority or the marketing authorisation  holder became aware of the  initial  report .  When an organisation  (competent authority or marketing authorisation holder ) is receiving follow -up  information on a case initially received and submitted to the EudraVigilance database by a different  organisation , the worldwide unique c ase identification number  of the initial report submitted by the  first organisation should be preserv ed in the subsequent submission s of the ICSR . In line with ICH E2B,     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 72/225     the senderâs (case)  safety  report unique identifier  and the senderâs identifier should be updated with  the new organisationâs own unique identifier s.   New follow -up information should  always be clearly identifiable in the case narrative  (required for  serious reports of suspected adverse reactions ) (data element ICH -E2B(R2) B.5.1) and should also be  provided captured  in a structured format  in the  as applicable  ICH-E2B(R2) data elements ..     In line with ICH -E2B the following applies data elements/sections should always be completed  for  follow -up ICSRs submission :  Reference  E2B(R2)/(R3) requirements   ICH-E2B(R2)   The following data elements should always be completed:   ï· Data element A.1.0.1 âSenderâs (case) safety report unique identifier â.  ï· Data element A.1.6 âDate report was first received from source â (which should  remain unchanged) .  ï· Data element A.1.7 âDate of receipt of the most recent information for this  report â.   ï· Data element A.1.10 âWorldw ide unique case identification number â (which  should remain unchanged) .  ï· Data element A.3.1.2 âSender identifier â.   ï· Data element B.5.1 âCase narrative including clinical course, therapeutic  measures, outcome and additional relevant informationâ (for serious  reports of  suspected adverse reactions) .

Significant information   Competent authorities in Member States or marketing authorisation holders  should  report submit   follow -up information ICSRs  if significant new medical information has been received. Significant  new information relates to , for example , a new suspected adverse reaction(s), reaction s, a change  in the causality assessment , and any new or up dated information on thea case that impacts on its  medical interpretation. Medical judgement should  therefore  be applied for Therefore, the  identification of significant new information requiring to be reported submitted  as follow -up ICSR   always necessitate s medical  judgement .     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 73/225     Situations where the seriousness criteria and/or the causality assessment are downgraded (e.g.  the follow -up information leads to a change of the seriousness criteria from serious to non - serious ; , or the causality assessment is change d from related to non -related) should also be   considered as significant change s and thus reported submitted as ICSR  (see VI.C.3. VI.B.7.1 . for  ICSRs reporting submission time frames) .  In addition, the competent authorit yies in a Member State s or the marketing authorisation holder s  should also report follow -up information, where submit a new version of an ICSR, when  new  administrative information is available, that could impa ct on the case management ; for. For  example , if new case identifiers have become known to the sender, which may have been used in  previous transmissions submission s (data element  âOther case identifiers in previous transmissionsâ   (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.11) ).. This information may be specifically relevant to manage potential  duplicates.

Another example refers to additional documents held by sender, whereby new documents that  have become available to the sender may be relevant for the medical asses sment of the case.  In  this context regard , the following data elements/ sections should be completed in line with ICH -E2B  :  Reference  E2B(R2)/(R3) requirements   ICH- E2B(R2)  ï· Section A.1.8 âAdditional available documents held by sender â.   ICH- E2B(R3)  ï· Section  C.1.6 âAdditional Available Documents Held by Sender â.  b. Non-significant information   In contrast, a follow -up report  which contain s non-significant information  does not require to be  report edsubmitted  as ICSR . This may refer , for exa mple, to minor changes to some  dates in the  case with no implication for the evaluation  or transmission  submission  of the case , or to some  corrections of typo graphical errors  in the previous case version.  Medical judg ement should be  applied  since a change to the birth date may  constitute a significant modification  (e.g. with  implications on the age information of the patient).  Similarly, a  change of the status of a MedDRA  code/term from current to non -current , due to a version change of MedDRA , can be considered as  a non -signific ant change as long as this change has no impact on the medica l content of a case.   However, an amendment of the MedDRA coding due to a change in the interpretation of a  previously reported suspected adverse reaction may constitute a significant change and t herefore  should be reported.      Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 74/225     In situations where the case is modified  without impact ing on its medical evaluation, while no new  follow -up is received (e.g.,  for correcting a mistake  or typographical error ), the date  of receipt of the  most recent informatio n reported in the data element âDate of receipt of the most recent in formation  for this reportâ (ICH -E2B(R2) A.1.7 ) should not be changed. This data element should  however  be  updated in any other situations , to the date when new follow -up information is r eceived (independently  whether it is significant or not ) or to the date when changes are made  which impact on the  interpretation  of the case .  Where follow -up information of a case initially reported submitted  by a marketing authorisation holder  is received directly by a competent authority, the âWorldwide worldwide  unique c ase identification  numberâ (ICH -E2B(R2) A.1.10) number   of the initial report should be mainta ined, in adherence with  ICH-E2B(R2) (see GVP Annex IV ). The same principle should be applied if a follow -up is received by a  marketing authorisation holder of a case initially reported submitted  by a competent authority.   VI.C.6.2.2.8. Amendment  Rreport   General guidance is provided in VI.B.7.3 .. Serious  and non -serious cases which have already been  submitted to EudraVigilance may need to be amended when, after an internal review or accor ding to  an expert opinion some  items have been corrected, without receipt of new information that would  warrant for the  submission of a follow -up report.    Where the amendment significantly impact s on the medical evaluation of the case, an ICSR should be  resubmitted  and information on the amendment should be explained  in the case narrative . For  example, an amendment of the MedDRA coding due to a change in the interpretation of a previously  submitted ICSR  may constitute a significant change and therefore should be sentresubmitted  as  amendment report  (see VI.C.6.2.2.7. Subsection a  and b for examples of significant and non - significant information) .   Additionally, for reports for which case s translations sh allould be provided by a marketing authorisation  holder s when  request ed by the Agency or another Member State s (see VI.C.6.2.2. 11. for EU guidance  on languages management in ICSRs ), the translations should be submitted in the form of  amendment  reports. The same would applyies where documentations  or articles mentioned in the ICSRs are  requested by the Agency or another Member State s and are further  sent as attachments  in data  element ICH E2B(R3) C.4.r.2  âIncluded documents â (the attachment of document is not available under   the ICH E2B(R 2) format ).  However when  nNew received information  (significant or non -significant) is received, it  should be  considered as follow -up report and not as amendment report and in this context, the guidance    provided in VI.C.6.2.2.7.  should be followed.   In line with ICH -E2B the following applies  for the submission of  amendment ICSRs :  Reference  E2B(R2)/(R3) requirements   ICH-E2B(R2)  The principle of amending a report as such possibility of flagging an ICSR as  amendment report  is not supported  under the  ICH-E2B(R2)  format . In situations,  wWhere the amendment of a report an ICSR  is necessary, the same principles as for  a follow -up report canshould  be applied , as follows  even where there is no receipt of   new information :.   ï· Data element A.1.0.1 âSenderâs (case) Sa fety Report Unique Identifierâ  should  remain  unchanged .  ï· Data element A.1.6 âDate report was first received from source â should remain     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 75/225     Reference  E2B(R2)/(R3) requirements   unchanged .  ï· Data ele ment A.1.7 âDate of receipt of the most recent information for this  reportâ should remain  unchanged .  ï· Data element A.1.10  âWorldwide Unique Case Identification Number â should  remain  unchanged .  ï· Data element A.3.1.2 âSender identifier â should remain  unchanged .  ï· Information on the amendment should be identifiable in the case narrative  (data  element B.5.1 ).  It should be noted that amendment ICSRs  submitted in  the ICH-E2B(R 2) format this  can lead to situation s, where these reports maywill appear as âlate reportsâ  i.e. do  not meet the established reporting timelines  in the  compliance monitoring  performed  by the Agen cy (see VI.C.6.2.4.  for guidance  on ICSRs data quality ) if they are  submitted  beyond the 15 or 90  days submission  time frame s since the date of  receipt of the most recent information .   In situations where the case is modified  without impacting on its medical evaluation ,  while no new follow -up is received (e.g., for correcting a mistake or typographical  error), the date  of receipt of the most recent information included in the data  element A.1.7 âDate of receipt of t he most recent information for this reportâ should  not be remain un  changed .  ICH-E2B(R3)   The d ata element C.1.11.1 âReport Nullification/Amendment â should be set to  âAmendment â.   The d ata element C.1.11.2 âReason for Nullification/Amendment â should be  compl eted to indicate the reason why a previously transmitted ICSR is  amended .  ï· The same Data element C.1.1  âSenderâs (case) Safety Report Unique Identifierâ  (data element C.1.1) previously submitted should be used remain unchanged .  (see exceptions in ICH ICSR Imp lementation Guide for C.1.1 ).

ICSRs set as amendment  reports in the ICH-E2B(R3)  format are not considered in  the compliance monitoring performe d by the Agency . They will be however  monitored as part of the regular review of the ICSRs quality  and integrity conducted  by the Agency (see VI.C.6.2.4.  for guidance  on ICSRs data quality ). This is  to ensure  that they have not been misclassified by the sending organisation as amendment   report s instead of follow -up reports which should be taken into account in the  compliance monitoring .  VI.C.6.2.2. 9. Nullification of cases   In line with ICH-E2B (see GVP Annex IV ), the nullification of individual cases should be used to indicate  that a previously transmitted re port should be considered completely void (nullified), for example when  the whole case was found to be erroneous or in case of duplicate reports . .   The following principles should be followed:   ï· The nullification reason should be clear and concise to explai n why this case is no longer  considered to be a valid report. For example a nullification reason stating, âthe report no longer  meets the reporting criteria  for submission â or âreport sent previously in errorâ are not detailed  enough explanations ;  ï· An indiv idual case can only be nullified by the original sending organisation ;  ï· Once an individual case has been nullified, the case cannot be reactivated ;  ï· Individual versions (i.e. follow -up reports) of a case cannot be nullified, only the entire individual  case t o which they refer ;  ï· A nullified case is one that should no longer be considered for scientific evaluation.  The process of  the nullification of a case is by means of a notification by the sender to the receiver that this is no  longer a valid case. However, the case should be retained in the senderâs  and receiverâs   pharmacovigilance database  for auditing purpose s.   In line with ICH -E2B the following should be applie dapplies for nullified ICSRs submission :  Reference  E2B(R2)/(R3) requirements   ICH-E2B(R2)   The d ata element A.1.13 âReport nullification â should be set to âYesâ .   The d ata element A.1.13.1 âReason for nullification â should be completed to  indicate the reason why a previously transmitted ICSR is considered completely  void.   ï· Data element A.1.0.1 âSender âs (case) Safet y Report Unique Identifierâ should  remain  unchanged .  ï· The same âWorldwide unique case identification number â (data element A.1.10 )  previously submitted should be used .Data element A.1.6 âDate report was first     Guideline on good pharmacovigil ance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 77/225     Reference  E2B(R2)/(R3) requirements   received from source â should rema in unchanged .  ï· The d Data element A.1.7 âDate of receipt of the most recent information for this  report â should either reflect the date when information was received that  warrants the nullification of the report or otherwise should remain unchanged ..    ï·   Data element A.1.10  âWorldwide unique case identification number â should  remain unchanged .  ï· Data element A.1.13 âReport nullification â should be set to âYesâ .  ï· Data element A.1.13.1 âReason for nullification â should be completed to indicate  the reason why a pre viously transmitted ICSR is considered completely void .  ï· Data element A.3.1.2 âSender identifier â should remain  unchanged .

What to take into account for d Data privacy protection  laws   To detect, assess, understand and prevent adverse reactions and to identify , and take actions to  reduce the risks of, and increase the benefits from  medicinal products for the purpose of safeguarding  public health, the processing of personal data concerning the patient or the primary source within the  EudraVigilance database is possible while respecting EU legislation in relation to data protection  (Directive 95/46/EC , , and Regulation (EC)  No 45/2001).   Where in accordance with the applicable national legislation, the patientâs direct identifiers  information  related to personal data  cannot be transferred to the EudraVigilance database , pseudonymisatio n may  be applied by the competent authorit ies y in the Member State s and by the marketing authorisation  holder s, thereby replacing identifiable personal  data such as name and address with pseudonyms or  key codes, for example in accordance with the ISO Tech nical Specification DD  ISO/TS 25237:2008,  Health informatics â Pseudonymization  [IR Recital 17 ]. The application of pseudonymisation will  facilitate the ability of the EudraVigilance system to adequately support case processing and detect  duplicates. ThisAlternatively  where pseudonymisation is not feasible, the following may be applied  in  line with ICH -E2B:  Reference  E2B(R2)/(R3) requirements   ICH-E2B(R2)  ï· In certain data element s which  can identify an individual such as in the  reporterâs name , initials , address , or in the  patient âs name , initials , medical  record number , where the information cannot be transmitted for data protection   reasons, the data element  should be populated with  the value  âPRIVACYâ , in line  with the EudraVigilance business rules detaile d in the Note for guidance -  EudraVigilance Human - Processing of Safety Messages and Individual Case  Safety Reports (ICSRs)  (EMA/H/20665/04/Final Rev. 2 ).  ICH-E2B(R3)  ï· The nullFlavornullflavor  âMSKâ (see VI.A.2.6.

Handling of languages    The ICH-E2B(R2) (see GVP Annex IV ) concept for the The electronic reporting submission  of ICSRs is  based on the fact that structured and coded information is used for data outputs of pharmacovigilance  systems (e.g. listings) and for signal detection. However, for scientific case assessment and signal  evaluation , the medi cal summary provided in the data element âCase narrative including clinical course,  therapeutic measures, outcome and additional relevant informationâ  (ICH-E2B(R2) B.5.1)  a medical  summary  is normally required  (see VI.6.2.2.4 . for guidance  on case narrative ).   Where suspected adverse reactions are reported by the primary source in narrative and textual  descriptions in an official language of the Union other than English, the original verbatim text and the  summary thereof in English shall be provided by the marketing authorisation holder81 [IR 28 (4)] . In  practice, the original verbatim text reported by the primary source in an official language of the Union  other than English should be included in the ICSR, i f it is requested by the Member State where the  reaction occurred or by the Agency.  The ICSR should be completed and submitted in English if not  otherwise  requested .  Member States may report case narratives in their official language(s). For those reports,  case  translations shall be provided when requested by the Agency or other Member States for the  evaluation of potential signals. For suspected adverse reactions originating outside the EU, English  shall be used in the ICSR  [IR 28 (4)] .   Additional documen ts held by the sender, which may be only available in a local language, should only  be translated if requested by the receiver.

VI.C.6.2.2.10. Nullification of cases   In line with ICH-E2B(R2)  (see GVP Annex IV ), the nullification of individual cases should be used to  indicate that a previously transmitted report should be considered completely void (nullified), for  example when the whole case was fo und to be erroneous or in case of duplicate reports. It is essential  to use the same case report number s previously submitted in the data element  âSenderâs (case) safety  report unique identifierâ  (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.0.1)  and in the data element  âWorldwide uni que case  identification numberâ  (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.10) .   A nullified case is one that should no longer be considered for scientific evaluation.  The process of the  nullification of a case is by means of a notification by the sender to the receiver that this i s no longer a  valid case. However, the case should be retained in the senderâs pharmacovigilance database  for  auditing purpose s.   The principles to be considered  when nullifying a case are detailed in VI. Appendix  5.

Competent  authorities in M ember States  and marketing authorisation holders  should regularly update their  training plans based on an assessment of the  training needs of their personnel for pharmacovigilance ,  which should be subject to monitoring. Records for documenting and developi ng the competences of  personnel should be maintained and updated accordingly.  To support assist  the training of personnel for  pharmacovigilance , the Agency has made available a detailed training plan  and catalogue  based on a  modular training approach focusi ng on the management  of individual safety reports adverse reaction s  reporting , signal s management and EudraVigilance86. It is accessible on the EudraVigilance training  webpage87 to stakeholders who wish to use it for their pharmacovigilance activities.   In sup port of the operation of the procedures that ensure the highest quality and full integrity of the  information collected in the EudraVigilance database as well as the monitoring of use of  the  terminologies for the submission  of ICSRs , business process maps  and process descriptions in relation  to the quality review of ICSRs and the are provided  in VI.App .6..   A review of the ICSRs quality, integrity and compliance with the reporting submission  time frames will  beis performed by the Agency at regular intervals for all organisations reporting submitting ICSRs  to  the EudraVigilance database in line with the Agencyâs SOPs . Parameters upon which the review of  organisations may be initiated, refer for example to the volume of reports being submitted to the  EudraVigilance  database , major changes to pharmacovigilance databases, quality issues identified as  part of the signal management, requests from pharmacovigilance inspectors , andor the time interval  since the last review.   For the purpose of the monitoring of the 15 or 90 days reporting time frames,  the Agency provides competent authorities in Member States  and marketing authorisation holders  with  monthly compliance reports.   The outcome of the review of the ICSRs quality  and integrity reviews  will be is provided to the  organisations on the basis of a report, which include s the need for corrective measures where  applicable and the time frames for these measures to be applied. The time frames and the method for  corrective measures will depend on the quality issues identified (e.g. corrections of the MedDRA coding  of ICSRs to be performed by means of amendment reports).   For the purpose of the monitoring of the compliance with the 15 or 90 days submission time frames,  the Agency also provides the competent authorit y in a Member State  and the marketing authorisation  holder  with monthly compliance reports , which apply to both initial and follow -up ICSRs. Specific rules  on the compliance monitoring for amendment reports are detailed in VI.C.6.2.2.8 ..   With regard to the monitoring by the Agency of selected medical literature for reports of suspected  adverse reactions to medicinal products containing certain active substances (see VI.C.2.2.3.1.  for EU  guidance on medical literature  monitoring ), and the entering of adverse reaction reports these reports   in the EudraVigilance database in accordance with Art icleicle 27 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  of  Regulation (EC) 726/2004 , two-yearly audits are planned to ensure the quality and integrity of the  reports. SOPs and WINs for the routine quality review process are published aton the Agencyâs  dedicated medical literature monitoring webpage .88.

The collaboration between the Agency, the competent authorit iesy  in a Member State s and the marketing authorisation holder s is required to ensure that potential  duplicates of reports of suspected adverse reactions are reviewed,  confirmed and processed as  necessary. Guidance  on the detection of duplicate ICSRs is available also provided  in the GVP Module VI  Addendum I â Duplicate management of adverse reaction reports Guideline on the Detection and  Management of Duplicate Individual Cases and Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs)   (EMA/13432/2009 ).  A review  of the ICSRs quality , integrity  and compliance with the reporting time frames  will be  performed by the Agency at regular intervals for all orga nisations reporting  to the EudraVigilance  database. Feedback from these reviews will be provided to those organisations.   VI.C.6.2.5. Electronic re-transmission of ICSRs  between multiple senders and receivers   The electronic re -transmission of cases refers t o the electronic exchange  of ICSRs between multiple  senders and receivers, for example  where in case of contractual agreement, a third country ICSR is  first reported submitted  by a marketing authorisation holder  outside the EU to another marketing  authorisa tion holder in the EU and from there  to the Agency.  This applies as well for the interim  arrangements period, where b ased on the reporting requirements detailed in VI.C.4.1 ., ICSRs  originating in the EU are subm itted by marketing authorisation holders to the competent authorities in  the Member State where the reaction occurred and then re-transmitted to the EudraVigilance  database .   During this re -transmission process, information on the case should not in princi ple be omitted or  changed if no new information on the case is available to the re -transmitting sender.  Exceptions apply  to the following  ICH-E2B data elements  or sections :  Exceptions apply to  the following  data elements  or sections :  ï· âSenderâs (case) safet y report unique identifierâ ( ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.0.1);   ï· âDate of this transmissionâ ( ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.3);   ï· âDate report was first received from sourceâ ( ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.6) , for initial reports;   ï· âDate of receipt of the most recent information for this reportâ ( ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.7);   ï· âInformation on sender and receiver of case safety reportâ  (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.3);  ï· âRelatedness of drug to reaction(s)/event(s) â (ICH-E2B(R2)  B.4.k.18) ;  ï· âSender's diagnosis/syndrome and/or reclassification of reaction/event â (ICH-E2B(R2)  B.5.3) ;  ï· âSenderâs comments â (ICH-E2B(R2)  B.5.4).

In the interest of improving data quality, in cas e of errors or inconsistencies in the report, the re - transmitters should go back to the originator of the report to correct the case accordingly. However, if  this cannot be done within normal reporting submission time frame s, the re -transmitter can correct   information that has been incorrectly structured.   In addition, any electronic data interchange  partner should adhere to the ICH-E2B(R2) rules regarding  the provision of follow -up information,  whereby  the âWorldwide unique case identification numberâ  (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.10) should be maintained in accordance with the ICH-E2B(R2)  guideline  (see GVP  Annex IV ).principles set out in VI.C.6.2.2.7 .. Non-adherence to these administrative requirements  endangers the electronic case manage ment and  leads to the potential for unnecessary duplication of  reports in the receiverâs database .   VI.C.6.2.6. Electronic reporting submission  of ICSRs through companyâs the headquarter  of  a marketing authorisation holder s  If a pharmaceutical company marketing authorisation holder  decides to centralise the electronic  reporting submission  of ICSRs (e.g. by reporting submitting  through the companyâs global or EU  headquarter), the following should be taken into account:   ï· the central  reporting submitting  arrangement should be clearly specified in the marketing  authorisation holder âs pharmacovigilance system master  file and in the interna l standard operating  procedures;   ï· the companyâs headquarter  designated for reporting submitting  the ICSRs should be  registered  with EudraVigilance ;.  ï· theThe same principles may be applied  for reporting ICSRs from the competent authori ties in  Member States to the marketing authorisation holder s during the interim arrangement s period ,     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 100/225     that is  the competent a uthorities in Member States report electronically to  the companyâs  headquarter  instead of to the local affiliate s.  VI.C.6.3. Electro nic submission of information on medicinal products   To support the objectives of Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the  provisions   provided in second sub -paragraph of Art icleicle 57(2)  of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  of Regulation  (EC) No 726/2004 , regarding  the electronic submission  and update of information on medicinal  products for human use authorised or registered in the EU , shall be followed by the marketing  authorisation holder s. In this aspect With regard to this,  the marketing auth orisation holder s shall apply  the internationally agreed formats and terminologies described in Cchapter IV of the Commission  Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012  of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No  520/2012 .

Appendix 2 Detailed guidance on the monitoring of  scientific the medical  literature   VI.App2App.2.1. When  to start and stop searching in the scientific  medical  literature   EU specific requirements , as regards the monitoring of the scientific and medical literature medical  literature  are provided in VI.C.2.2.3 ..  In add ition to the reporting submission  of serious and non -serious ICSRs or their presentation in  periodic safety update reports , the marketing authorisation holder  has an obligation to review the  world wide experience with medicinal product in the period between  the submission of the marketing  authorisation application and the granting of the marketing authorisation.  The worldwide experience  include s published scientific and medical literature medical literature . For the period between  submission and granting of a  marketing authorisation, literature searching should be conducted to  identify published articles that provide information that could impact on the risk -benefit assessment of  the product under evaluation . For the purpose of the preparation of periodic safe ty update report s (see  GVP Module VII ) and the notification of emerging safety issues  (see VI.C.2.2.6 . and GVP Module I X for  guidance on emerging  safety issue ), the requirement for literature searching is not dependent on a  product being marketed. Literature searches should be conducted for all products with a marketing  authorisation, irrespective of commercial status. It would therefore be expecte d that literature  searching would start on submission of a marketing authorisation application and continue while the  authorisation is active.   VI.App2App.2.2 Where to look   Articles relevant to the safety of medicinal products are usually published in well -recognised scientific  and medical journals ,; however , new and important information may be first presented at international  symposia or in local journals. Although the most well -known databases (e.g. Medline) cover the  majority of scientific and medical journals, the most relevant publications may be collated elsewhere in  very specialised medical fields for certain types of product (e.g. herbal medicinal products) , or where  safety concerns are subject to non -clinical research. The marketing authorisation ho lder should  establish the most relevant source of published literature for each product.   Medline, Embase and Excerpta Medica are often used for the purpose of identifying  ICSRs. These  databases have broad medical subject coverage.  Other recognised appropr iate systems may be used .  The database providers can advise on the sources of records, the currency of the data, and the nature  of database inclusions. It is best practice to have selected one or more databases appropriate to a  specific product. For exampl e, in risk -benefit assessment, safety issues arising during non -clinical  safety studies may necessitate regular review of a database that has a less clinical focus and includes  more laboratory -based publications.   Relevant published abstracts from meetings  and draft manuscripts should be reviewed for valid  reportable ICSRs  and for inclusion in periodic safety update report s. Although it is not a requirement  for marketing authorisation holder s to attend all such meetings, if there are company personnel at  such a meeting, or it is sponsored by a marketing authorisation holder , it is expected that articles of  relevance would be available to the marketing authorisation holder 's pharmacovigilance system. In  addition, literature that is produced or sponsored by a marketing authorisation holder  should be  reviewed, so that any valid reportable ICSRs can be reported submitted  as required in advance of  publication. If ICSRs are brought to the attention of a marketing authorisation holder  from this source,  they should be  processed in the same way as ICSRs found on searching a database or reviewing a     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 126/225     journal. Abstracts from major scientific meetings are indexed and available in some databases, but  posters and communications are rarely available from this source.   VI.App2.3.Guidance in  VI.C.2.2.3.  should be followed for the searches of databases with broad medical  coverage by the Agency in accordance with Art icleicle 27 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  of Regulation  (EC) 726/2004  and the  ICSRs submission  reporting  obligations of marketing authorisation holders in  accordance with Art icleicle 107 (3) of Directive 2001/83/EC  of Directive 2001/83/EC .   VI.App.2.3 Database Searches   A search is more than a collection of terms used to inte rrogate a database. Decisions about the  database selection, approach to records retrieval, term or text selection and the application of limits  need to be relevant to the purpose of the search. For searches in pharmacovigilance, some of the  considerations for database searching are described below.   VI.App2App.2.3.1. Precision and recall   Medical and scientific databases are a collection of records relating to a set of publications. For any  given record, each database has a structure that facilitates the orga nisation of records and searching  by various means, from simple text to complex indexing terms with associated subheadings. Search  terms (text or indexed) can be linked using Boolean operators and proximity codes to combine  concepts, increasing or decreasi ng the specificity of a search. In addition, limits to the output can be  set. When searching, the application of search terms means that the output is less than the entire  database of the records held. The success of a search can be measured according to p recision and  recall (also called sensitivity). Recall is the proportion of records retrieved ("hits") when considering  the total number of relevant records that are present in the database. Precision is the proportion of  "hits" that are relevant when consi dering the number of records that were retrieved. In general, the  higher recall searches would result in low precision.   VI.App2App.2.3.2. Search construction   Databases vary in structure, lag time in indexing and indexing policy for new terms. While some  database providers give information about the history of a particular indexing term or the application  of synonyms, other databases are less sophisticated. In addition, author abstracts are not always  consistent in the choice of words relating to pharmacovi gilance concepts or medicinal products/active  substances  names.   When constructing a search for pharmacovigilance, the highest recall for a search would be to enter  the medicinal product  name  and active substance  name  (in all their variants) only. In practi ce,  additional indexing terms and text are added to increase precision and to reduce the search result to  return records that are of relevance to pharmacovigilance. There is a balance to be achieved. It is ,  therefore , expected that complicated searches are  accompanied by initial testing to check that relevant  records are not omitted , however, there is no defined acceptable loss of recall when searching for  pharmacovigilance purposes. Term selection should be relevant to the database used and the subject  of the search.   VI.App2App.2.3.3. Selection of product terms   Searches should be performed to find records for active substance s and not for brand names only. This  can also include excipients or adjuvants  that may have a pharmacological effect. When choosing  search terms for medicinal product s, there are a number of considerations.      Guideline on good pharmacovi gilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 127/225     ï· Is the active substance  an indexed term?   ï· What spellings might be used by authors (particularly if the active substance  is not indexed)?   ï· What alternative names might apply (numbers or codes used for products newly developed,  chemical names, brand names, active metabolites)?   ï· Is it medically relevant to search only for a particular salt or specific  compound for an active  substance ?  During searches for ICSRs, it may be possible to construc t a search that excludes records for  pharmaceutical forms or routes of administration different t o that of the subject product,  however,  restrictions should allow for the inclusion of articles where this is not specified. Search construction  should also al low for the retrieval of overdose , medication error, abuse , misuse , off-label use  or  occupational exposure  information, which could be poorly indexed. Searches should also not routinely  exclude records of unbranded products or records for other company bra nds.  VI.App2App.2.3.4. Selection of search terms   As described previously, there is no acceptable loss of recall when searching published literature for  pharmacovigilance. The use of search terms (free text or use of indexing) to construct more precise  searches may assist in managing the output. Deficiencies that have been found frequently during  Competent Authority inspections include:   ï· the omission of outcome terms,  for example "death" as an outcome may be the only indexed term  in a case of sudden  death;   ï· the omission of pregnancy terms t o find adverse outcomes in pregnancy for submission as ICSR  reporting ;  ï· the omission of terms to include special types of report s which needs to be addressed as well in  periodic safety update reports , for example,   ï­ Reports of  asymptomatic overdose , medication error , misuse, abuse, occupational exposure ;   ï­ Reports of  uneventful pregnancy .  VI.App2App.2.3.5. Limits to a search   Some databases apply indexing that allows the application of limits to a search, for example by subject  age, sex, publication type. The limits applied to a search are not always shown in the "search strategy"  or search string.   If limits are applied, they should be relevant to the purpose of the search. When searching a worldwide  scientific and medical literatu remedical literature  database, titles and abstracts are usually in English  language. The use of limits that reduce the search result to only those published in the English  language is generally not acceptable. Limits applied to patient types, or other aspe cts of an article, for  example human, would need to be justified in the context of the purpose of a search.   Limits can be applied to produce results for date ranges,  for example, weekly searches can be obtained  by specifying the start and end date for the records to be retrieved. Care should be taken to ensure  that the search is incl usive for an entire time period,  for example, records that may have been added  later in the day for the day of the search should be covered in the next search period. The search   should also retrieve all records added in that period, and not just those initially entered or published     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 128/225     during the specified period (so that records that have been updated or retrospectively added are  retrieved). This should be checked with the database provider if it is not clear.   Although one of the purposes of searching is to identify valid ICSRs which qualify for  reporting submission , the use of publication type limits is not robust. ICSRs may be presented within  review or study publications, and such records may not be indexed as "case -reports", resulting in their  omission for preparation of periodic safety update reports from search results limited by publication  type.  VI.App2App.2.4. Record keeping   Records of literature searches  should be maintained in accordance with  the requirements described in  Article 12 of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012 . Marketing authorisation  holder s should  demonstrate due diligence in searching published scientific and medical  literature medical literat ure. It is always good practice to retain a record of the search construction, the  database used and the date the search was run. In addition, it may be useful to retain results of the  search for an appropriate period of time, particularly in the event of zero results. If decision making is  documented on the results, it is particularly important to retain this information.   VI.App2App.2.5. Outputs   Databases can show search results in different ways, for example , titles only or title and abstract with  or with out indexing terms. Some publications are of obvious relevance at first glance, whereas others  may be more difficult to identify. Consistent with the requirement to provide the full citation for an  article and to identify relevant publications, the title, citation and abstract (if available) should always  be retrieved and reviewed.   VI.App2App.2.6. Review and selection of articles   It is recognised that literature search results are a surrogate for the actual article. Therefore, it is  expected that the person  reviewing the results of a search is trained  to identify the articles of  relevance. This may be an information professional trained in pharmacovigilance or a  pharmacovigilance professional with knowledge of the database used. Recorded confirmation that th e  search results have been reviewed will assist in demonstrating that there is a systematic approach to  collecting information about suspected adverse reactions from literature sources. It is recommended  that quality control checks are performed on a sampl e of literature reviews / selection of articles to  check the primary reviewer is identifying the relevant articles.   A common issue in selecting relevant articles from the results of a search is that often this process is  conducted for the purposes of ident ification of ICSRs only. Whereas the review should also be used as  the basis for collating articles for the periodic safety update report  production, therefore relevant  studies with no ICSRs should also be identified, as well as those reports of events  that do not qualify  for reporting submission as ICSR  (see VI.C.2.2.3.2.  for the exclusion criteria in the submission of ICSRs  published in the medical  literature ).  Outputs from searches may contain enough i nformation to be a valid ICSR, in which case the article  should be ordered. All articles for search results that are likely to be relevant to pharmacovigilance  requirements should be obtained, as they may contain valid ICSRs or relevant safety information . The  urgency with which this occurs should be proportionate  to the content of the material reviewed  and the  resulting requirement for action as applicable for  the marketing authorisation holder .      Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 129/225     Articles can be excluded f orom the submission of valid ICSRs  reporting by the marketing authorisation  holder  if another company's branded medicinal product is the suspect ed medicinal product. In the  absence of a specified medicinal product source and/or invented name, ownership of the medicinal  product should be as sumed for articles about an active substance. Alternative reasons for  the exclusion  of a published article for the reporting submission of ICSRs are detailed in VI.C.2.2.3.2. .  VI.App2App.2.7. Day zero   As described in VI.B.7 ., day zero is the date on which an organisation becomes aware of a publication  containing the minimum information for a n ICSR to be reportable qualify for submission . Awareness of  a publicat ion includes any personnel of that organisation, or third parties with contractual  arrangements with the organisation. It is sometimes possible to identify the date on which a record  was available on a database, although with weekly literature searching, d ay zero for the submission of  an reportable  adverse reaction present in an abstract is taken to be the date on which the search was  conducted. For articles that have been ordered as a result of literature search results, day zero is the  date when the minim um information for a n ICSR to be valid is available . Organisations should take  appropriate measures to obtain articles promptly in order to confirm the validity of a case.   VI.App2App.2.8. Duplicates   Consistent with the general requirements for the reportin g submission  of cases  of suspected adverse  reactions ICSRs , literature cases should be checked to prevent reporting the submission  of duplicates   ICSRs , and previously reported cases should be identified as such when reported . It is, therefore,  expected that ICSRs are checked in the organisation database to identify literature articles that have  already been reported submitted . Where applicable, this should include ICSRs resulting from the  Agencyâs Medical Literature Monitoring activities in accordance with Art icleicle 27 of Regulation (EC) No  726/2004  of Regulation (EC) 726/2004 .  VI.App2App.2.9. Contracting out literature search services   It is possible to use the services of another party to conduct searches of the published scientific and  medical literature medical literature . In this event, the responsibility for the performance of the search  and subsequent reporting submission of ICSRs  still remains . with the exception of the provisions set  out in Art icleicle 27 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  of Regulation EC)  726/2004 and Articleicle 107(3)  of Directive 2001/83/EC  of Directive 2001/83/EC . The transfer of a pharmacovigilance task or function  should be detailed in a contract between the organisation and the service provider. The nature of third  party arrangement s for literature searching can range from access to a particular database interface  only (access to a technology) to full literature searching, review and reporting ICSRs submission  (using  the professional pharmacovigilance services of another organisation ). It is recognised that more than  one organisation may share services of a third party to conduct searches for generic active substance s.  In this instance, each organisation should satisfy itself that the search and service is appropriate to  their needs  and obligations .   Where an organisation is dependent on a particular service provider for literature searching, it is  expected that an assessment of the service(s) is undertaken to determine whether it meets the needs   and obligations of the organisation. In  any case, the arrangement should be clearly documented.   The clock start for the reporting submission  of ICSRs begins with awareness of the minimum  information by either the organisation or the  contractual partner (whichever  is the earliest). This also  applies where a third par ty provides a review or  a collate d report from the published scientific and  medical literature medical literature , in order to ensure that published literature cases are     Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module VI  (Rev 2)    EMA/873138 /2011  Rev 2  Track -change version following public consultation (not to be quoted as final)  Page 130/225     reported submitted  as required within the correct  time frames. That  is, day zero is the date the search  was run if the minimum criteria are available in the abstract and not the date the information was  supplied to the organisation.   VI.App2App.2.10. Electronic submission of copies of articles  on suspected  adverse reaction s published in the scientific medical  literature   Until standards for the electronic transmission of attachments (e.g. copies of literature articles) are  developed in the framework of ICH, the sender should follow the rules outlined below for the  submission  of a copy of the literature article as detailed in VI.C.6.2.3.2 .:  Mailing address and format of literature articles:   Literature articles reportable to the Agency should be provided in PDF format and sent via e -mail t o the  following e -mail address: EVLIT@ema.europa.eu .

In addition, all ICSRs which relate to the same literature article should be cross r eferenced in the data  element âIdentification number of the report which is linked to this reportâ (ICH -E2B(R2) A.1.12). The  data element should be repeated as necessary to cross refer all related cases  (see Table VI.2 .).

Appendix 5 Nullification of cases   General principles regarding the n ullification of cases are provided in VI.C.6.2.2.10 . The following  recommendation soutlined  in VI.C.6.2.2. 9.   Examples of scenarios for which ICSRs  should also be applied :be nullified , are provided in Table VI.1 3..  b. The value in the data element âReport nullificationâ (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.13) should be set to âYesâ  and the nullification reason should be provided in the data element  âReason for nullificationâ   (ICH-EB(R2) A.1.13.1) . The nullification reason should be clear and concise to explain why this  case is no longer considered to be a valid report. For example a nullification reason stating,  âthe report no longer meets the reporting criteriaâ or âreport sent previously in erro râ are not  detailed enough explanations.   c. An individual case can only be nullified by the sending organisation.   d. Once an individual case has been nullified, the case cannot be reactivated.   e. If it becomes necessary to resubmit the case that has been previously  nullified, a new âSenderâs  (case) safety report unique identifierâ (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.0.1) and âWorldwide unique case  identification numberâ (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.10) should be assigned.   f. Individual versions (i.e. follow -up reports) of a case cannot be nullified,  only the entire individual  case to which they refer .  Table VI.10. Table VI.11.  Examples of scenarios for which ICSRs cases  should be nullified   Ex. Scenario  Action   1 An individual case has been identified as  a duplicate of another individual case  previously submitted . by the same  sender . One of the individual cases should be nullified. The  remaining valid case should be updated with any  additional  relevant  information from the nullified  case.  ï· NOTE: In case of duplicate reports where one  report needs to be nullified, the update of t he  remaining case should be performed in the form  of a follow -up report96. Information on the  identification of the nullified case(s) should be  provided  in the follow -up ICSR  (Section ICH- E2B(R2) A.1.11/  ICH-E2B(R3) C.1.9.1 âOther  case identifiers in previo us transmissions â).  2 A wrong âWorldwide unique c ase  identification numberâ (ICH -E2B(R2)  A.1.10 / ICH-E2B(R3) C.1.8.1 ) was  accidentally used and does not refer to  an existing case.  The case with the wrong âWorldwide unique c ase  identification numberâ (ICH -E2B(R2) A.1.10 / ICH - E2B(R3) C.1.8.1 ) should be nullified .  A new case should be created with a correct  âWorldwide unique case identification numberâ.   3 On receipt of further information it is  confirmed that that the adverse  reaction (s) occurred before the suspect The case should be nullified.                                                    96 See guidance provided in GVP Module VI Addendum I â Duplicate management of adverse reaction reports .Guidelin e on  the Detection and Management of Duplicate Individual Cases and Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) ,  EMA/13432/2009 .

Minimum reporting criteria for   an ICSR submission as outlined in VI.B.2   are no longer met.  The case should be nullified.   5 On receipt of further information it is  confirmed by the same reporter that the  reported adverse reaction(s) did not  occur to the patient.  Minimum reporting   criteria for  an ICSR submission as  outlined in VI.B.2 are no longer met.  The case should be nullified.   6 On receipt of further information it is  confirmed that there was no  valididentifiable  patient for the indivi dual  case.

If it there  is confirmation in a follow -up report that  no patient was involved, not possible to  obtain  confirmation o fverify  the patientâs existence, then   the case should be nullified.   a. Individual cases that have been nullified Examples of scenarios for which ICSRs  should notNOT  be used for scientific evaluation , however , they should remain in the database for auditing  purposes.   In addition, in case of duplicate reports where one report needs to be nullified, the update of the  remaining case should be performed in the form of a follow -up report97. Information on the  identification of the nullified case(s) should be nullified , are provided in the data element âSource(s) of  the case identifier (e.g. name of the company, name of regulatory agency)â (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.11.1 )  and in the data element âCase identifier(s)â (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.11.2) .Table VI.1 4..

However, the  patient received another suspect ed  drugsproduct (active substance )  previously not reported  and the  minimum reporting criteria for  an ICSR  submission  are still met.  The case should not be  nullified.    A follow -up should be submitted within the  appropriate time fram e with the updated information  on the case .   The case narrative should clearly indicate that the  patient did not receive the companyâs medicinal  product.   The new suspected medici nal product (active  substance) should be  specified  in section  âDrug  information â (ICH-E2B(R2) B.4/ ICH-E2B(R3) G.k) of  the ICSR . Further, i t is recommended that the initial  sender informs the other marketing authorisation  holder  about this case (including the âWorldwide  Unique Case Identification Numberâ (ICH-E2B(R2)  A.1.10  / ICH -E2B(R3) C.1.8.1) .

INTRODUCTION  It is important to establish an internationally standardized procedure in order to  improve the quality of post-approval safety information and to harmonise the way of  gathering and reporting information.  Th e ICH E2A guideline provides guidance on  pre-approval safety data management. Al though many stakeholders have applied  ICH E2A concepts to the post-approval phas e, there is a need to provide further  guidance on definitions and standards for post-approval expedited reporting, as well  as good case management practices.  This guideline is based on the content of ICH E2A guideline, with consideration as to ho w the terms and definitions can be applied  in the post-approval phase of the product life cycle.  2. DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOL OGY ASSOCIATED WITH POST- APPROVAL DRUG SAFETY EXPERIENCE  2.1 Adverse Event (AE)  An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necessa rily have to have a causal relationship  with this treatment.  An adverse even t can therefore be any unfavorable and  unintended sign (for example, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered  related to this medicinal product.  2.2 Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)   Adverse drug reactions, as established by regional regulations, guidance, and  practices, concern noxious and unintende d responses to a medicinal product.  The phrase âresponses to a medicinal productâ means that a causal relationship  between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility  (refer to the ICH E2A guideline).  A reaction, in contrast to an event, is characterized by the fact that a causal  relationship between the drug and the o ccurrence is suspected.  For regulatory  reporting purposes, if an event is spontaneously reported, even if the relationship is  unknown or unstated, it meets the definition of an adverse drug reaction.   2.3 Serious AE/ADR  In accordance with the ICH E2A guideline, a serious adverse event or reaction is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  * results in death,  * is life-threatening (NOTE: The term âlife-threateningâ in the definition of âseriousâ refers to an  event/reaction in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event/reaction; it does not refer to an event/ reaction which hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe),  * requires inpatient hospitalisation or results in prolongation of existing  hospitalisation,  * results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, Post-Approval Safety Data Management:  Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting    2 * is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  * is a medically important event or reaction.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other  situations should be considered serious such as important medical events that  might not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation  but might jeopardise the patient or migh t require intervention to prevent one  of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  Examples of such events  are intensive treatment in an emergenc y room or at home for allergic  bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in  hospitalization, or development of  drug dependency or drug abuse.  2.4 Unexpected ADR  An ADR whose nature, severity, specificity, or outcome is not consistent with the term  or description used in the local/regional  product labeling (e.g. Package Insert or  Summary of Product Characteristics) should be considered unexpected.  When a Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) is uncertain whether an ADR is expected or  unexpected, the ADR should be treated as unexpected.  An expected ADR with a fatal outcome should be considered unexpected unless the  local/regional product labeling specifically states that the ADR might be associated  with a fatal outcome.   âClass ADRsâ should not automatically be considered to be expected for the subject  drug. âClass ADRsâ should be considered ex pected only if described as specifically  occurring with the product in the local/regional product labeling.  This is illustrated in the following examples:  â¢ âAs with other drugs of this class, the following undesirable effect occurs with  Drug X.â  â¢ âDrugs of this class, including Drug X, can cause...â  If the ADR has not been documented with Drug X, statements such as the following are likely to appear in the local/regional product labeling:    â¢ âOther drugs of this class are reported to causeâ¦â  â¢ âDrugs of this class are reported to cause..., but no reports have been received  to date with Drug X.â   In these situations, the ADR should not be considered as expected for Drug X.  NOTE: The term âlistednessâ is not applicable to expedited reporting but should be  used to characterize the ADR according to the Company Core Safety Information  (refer to ICH E2C guideline for definitions).   2.5 Healthcare Professional  Healthcare professional is defined as a medi cally-qualified person such as a physician,  dentist, pharmacist, nurse, coroner, or as otherwise specified by local regulations.   2.6 Consumer  Consumer is defined as a person who is not a healthcare professional such as a  patient, lawyer, friend, or relative of a patient.  Post-Approval Safety Data Management:  Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting    3 3. SOURCES Of INDIVIDUAL CASE SAFETY REPORTS   3.1 Unsolicited Sources  3.1.1 Spontaneous Reports  A spontaneous report is an unsolicited communi cation by a healthcare professional or  consumer to a company, regulatory autho rity or other organization (e.g. WHO,  Regional Center, Poison Control Center) th at describes one or more adverse drug  reactions in a patient who was given one or  more medicinal products and that does  not derive from a study or any organized data collection scheme.  Stimulated reporting can occur in certain si tuations, such as notification by a âDear  Healthcare Professionalâ letter, publication in the press, or questioning of healthcare  professionals by company representatives.   These reports should be considered  spontaneous.  Consumer adverse reaction reports shou ld be handled as spontaneous reports  irrespective of any subsequent âmedical co nfirmationâ.  Regulatory Authorities might  require medical confirmation for the purpos e of expedited reporting. Emphasis should  be placed on the quality of the report and not on its source.  Even if reports received  from consumers do not qualify for regulatory reporting, the cases should be retained.   3.1.2 Literature   Each MAH is expected to regularly screen  the worldwide scientific literature by  accessing widely used systematic literat ure reviews or reference databases.  The  frequency of the literature searches should be according to local requirements or at least every two weeks. Cases of ADRs from the scientific and medical literature, including relevant published abstracts from meetings and draft manuscripts, might  qualify for expedited reporting.  A regulatory  reporting form with relevant medical  information should be provided for each identifiable patient.  The publication  reference(s) should be given as the report source; additionally a copy of the article  might be requested by the local regulatory  authority to accompany the report.  All  company offices are encouraged to be aware of publications in their local journals and to bring them to the attention of the co mpany safety department as appropriate.   The regulatory reporting time clock starts  as soon as the MAH has knowledge that  the case meets minimum criteria for reportability.   If the product source, brand, or trade name is not specified, the MAH should assume that it was its product, although the report should indicate that the specific brand was not identified.  If multiple products are mentioned in the a rticle, a report should be submitted only by  the applicant whose product is suspected.  The suspect product is that identified as such by the article's author.    3.1.3 Internet   MAHs should regularly screen websites und er their management or responsibility for  potential ADR case reports.  MAHs are not expected to screen external websites for  ADR information. However, if an MAH be comes aware of an adverse reaction on a  website that it does not manage, the MAH should review the case and determine  whether it should be reported.   Post-Approval Safety Data Management:  Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting    4 MAHs should consider utilising their websites to facilitate ADR data collection, e.g.,  by providing ADR forms for reporting or by  providing appropriate contact details for  direct communication.    Unsolicited cases from the Internet should be handled as spontaneous reports. For the  determination of reportability, the same criteria should be applied as for cases provided via other ways.    In relation to such cases from the Internet e.g. e-mail, identifiability of the reporter  refers to the existence of a real person, i.e., it is possible to verify that the patient and  the reporter exist.  3.1.4 Other Sources  If an MAH becomes aware of a case report from  non-medical sources, e.g. the lay press  or other media, it should be handled as a spontaneous report.  For the determination of reportability, the same criteria shou ld be applied as for other reports.   3.2 Solicited Sources  Solicited reports are those derived from organized data collection systems, which  include clinical trials, registries, post-a pproval named patient use programs, other  patient support and disease management programs, surveys of patients or healthcare  providers, or information gathering on effi cacy or patient compliance.  Adverse event  reports obtained from any of these should not be considered spontaneous.   For the purposes of safety reporting, solicited reports should be classified as study reports, and therefore should have an appropriate causality assessment by a  healthcare professional or an MAH.  Furth er guidance on study-related issues, such  as managing blinded therapy cases, can be found in the ICH E2A guideline.  3.3 Contractual Agreements  The marketing of many medicines increas ingly takes place through contractual  agreements between two or more companies, which may market same product in the same or different countries/region.  Arrang ements vary considerably with respect to  inter-company communication and regulatory re sponsibilities.  Overall, this can be a  complex issue.  In such relationships, it is very impo rtant that explicit licensing/contractual  agreements specify the processes for exc hange of safety information, including  timelines and regulatory reporting respon sibilities. Safety personnel should be  involved in development of any agreements from the beginning.  Processes should be  in place to avoid duplicate reporting to the regulatory  authority, e.g. assigning  responsibility to one company for literature screening.    Whatever the nature of the arrangement, the MAH is ultimately responsible for regulatory reporting. Therefore, every reas onable effort should be made between the  contracting partners to minimize the da ta exchange period so as to promote  compliance with MAH responsibilities.  3.4 Regulatory Authority Sources  Individual serious unexpected adverse drug reaction reports originating from foreign regulatory authorities are subject to expedited reporting to other authorities by each  MAH.  Re-submission of serious ADR cases without new information to the Post-Approval Safety Data Management:  Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting    5 originating regulatory authority is not us ually necessary, unless otherwise specified  by local regulation.  4. STANDARDS FOR EXPEDITED REPORTING  4.1 What Should Be Reported?  4.1.1 Serious ADRs  Cases of adverse drug reactions that are both serious and unexpected are subject to  expedited reporting.  The reporting of se rious expected reactions in an expedited  manner varies among countries.  Non-serious adverse reactions, whether expected or  not, would normally not be subject to expedited reporting.    For reports from studies and other solicited sources, all cases judged by either the  reporting healthcare professional or the MAH as having a possible causal relationship to the medicinal product would qualify as  ADRs.  For purposes of reporting,  spontaneous reports associated with ap proved drugs imply a suspected causal  relationship.  4.1.2 Other Observations   In addition to single case reports, any safe ty information from other observations that  could change the risk-benefit evaluation fo r the product should be communicated as  soon as possible to the regulatory authori ties in accordance with local regulation.  Examples include any significant unanticipat ed safety findings from an in vitro,  animal, epidemiological, or clinical study that suggest a significant human risk, such  as evidence of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity, or lack of efficacy with a drug used in treating a life-threatening or serious disease.  4.1.2.1 Lack of Efficacy   Evidence of lack of efficacy should not norm ally be expedited, but should be discussed  in the relevant periodic safety update re port. However, in certain circumstances and  in some regions, individual reports of la ck of efficacy are considered subject to  expedited reporting. Medicinal products used for the treatment of life-threatening or  serious diseases, vaccines, and contraceptiv es are examples of classes of medicinal  products where lack of efficacy should be considered for expedited reporting.  Clinical  judgment should be used in reporting, with consideration of the local product labeling and disease being treated.   4.1.2.2 Overdose   Reports of overdose with no associated adverse outcome should not be reported as adverse reactions.  Cases associated with  serious adverse reactions are considered  subject to expedited reporting, unless otherw ise specified by local regulation.  They  should be routinely followed up to ensure that the information is as complete as  possible with regard to symptoms, treatment, and outcome.  The MAH should collect  any available information on overdose related to its products.   4.2 Minimum Criteria for Reporting    It is recommended that as much information as possible be collected at the time of the  initial report.  However, for the purpose of regulatory reporting, the minimum data  elements for an ADR case are: an identifiab le reporter, an identifiable patient, an  adverse reaction, and a suspect product.  La ck of any of these four elements means Post-Approval Safety Data Management:  Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting    6 that the case is considered incomplete; ho wever, MAHs are expected to exercise due  diligence to collect the missing data elements.  4.3 Reporting Time Frames  In general, expedited reporting of serious and unexpected ADRs is required as soon as  possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days of initial receipt of the information  by the MAH.  Time frames for other type s of serious reports vary among countries,  depending on source, expectedness and outcome.   The regulatory reporting time clock is co nsidered to start on the date when any  personnel of the MAH first receive a case report that fulfills minimum criteria as well as the criteria for expedited reporting.  In general, this date should be considered  day 0.  When additional medically relevant informat ion is received for a previously reported  case, the reporting time clock is considered to begin again for submission of the follow- up report.  In addition, a case initially classified as a non-ex pedited report, would  qualify for expedited reporting upon receipt of follow-up information that indicates  the case should be re-classified (e.g., from non serious to serious).    4.4 Non-serious ADRs  Cases of non-serious ADRs, whether expe cted or not, would not normally be  considered reportable on an expedited basis.  Non-serious ADRs should be included in  the periodic safety update report acco rding to the ICH E2C guideline.    5. GOOD CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES  Accurate, complete, and bona fide inform ation is very important for MAHs and  regulatory agencies identifying and assessi ng ADR reports.  Both are faced with the  task of acquiring sufficient information to help ensure that the reports are authentic,  accurate, as complete as possible, and non-duplicative.   5.1 Assessing Patient and Reporter Identifiability1 Patient and reporter identifiability is important to avoid case duplication, detect fraud, and facilitate follow-up of appropriat e cases.  The term identifiable in this  context refers to the verification of th e existence of a patient and a reporter.   Local data privacy laws regarding patient and reporter identifiability might apply.   One or more of the following should autom atically qualify a patient as identifiable:  age (or age category, e.g., adolescent, adult,  elderly), gender, initials, date of birth,  name, or patient identification number.  In addition, in the event of second-hand reports, every reasonable effort should be  made to verify the existence of an  identifiable patient and reporter.  All parties supplying case information or approached for case information should be identifiable: not only the initial reporter (t he initial contact for the case), but also  others supplying information.   In the absence of qualifying descriptors, a report referring  to a definite number of  patients should not be regarded as a ca se until the minimum four criteria for case  reporting are met.  For example, âTwo pa tients experiencedâ¦â or â a few patients  experiencedâ should be followed up for patient-identifiable information before  regulatory reporting.  Post-Approval Safety Data Management:  Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting    7 5.2 The Role of Narratives   The objective of the narrative is to summarize all relevant clinical and related  information, including patient characteri stics, therapy details, medical history,  clinical course of the event(s), diagno sis, and ADR(s) including the outcome,  laboratory evidence (including normal ranges), and any other information that  supports or refutes an ADR.  The narrative should serve as a comprehensive, stand-alone âmedical storyâ. The information should be presented in a logical time sequence;  ideally this should be presented in the chronology of the patientâs experience, rather  than in the chronology in which the information was received.  In follow-up reports, new information should be clearly identified.  Abbreviations and acronyms should be avoi ded, with the possible exception of  laboratory parameters and units.  Key information from supplementary records  should be included in the report, and their availability should be mentioned in the  narrative and supplied on request.  Any re levant autopsy or post-mortem findings  should also be summarized in the narrative and related documents should be  provided according to local regulation and if allowed by local data privacy laws.    Terms (e.g., AEs/ADRs, indication, and medica l conditions) in the narrative should be  accurately reflected in appropriate data fields.  5.3 Clinical Case Evaluation   The purpose of careful medical review is to  ensure correct interpretation of medical  information.  Preferably, information about  the case should be collected from the  healthcare professionals who are directly invo lved in the patientâs care. Regardless of  the source of an ADR report, the recipient should carefully review the report for the  quality and completeness of the medical information. The review should include, but  is not limited to, the following considerations:   â¢  Is a diagnosis possible?   â¢  Have the relevant diagnostic procedures been performed?   â¢  Were alternative causes of the reaction(s) considered?   â¢  What additional information is needed?   ADR terms should be used consistently  and in accordance with recommended  standards for diagnosis, if possible.  The report should include the verbatim term as used by the reporter, or an accurate tr anslation of it.  Any company personnel  receiving reports should provide an unbiased  and unfiltered report of the information  from the reporter.  While th e report recipient is encourag ed to actively query the  reporter to elicit the most complete acco unt possible, inferences and imputations  should be avoided in report submission.  Ho wever, clearly identified evaluations by  the MAH are considered appropriate and are required by some regulatory authorities.  When a case is reported by a consumer, his/her description of the event should be retained, although confirmatory or addi tional information from any relevant  healthcare professionals should also be sought and included.    5.4 Follow-up Information   The information from ADR cases when first received is generally incomplete. Ideally,  comprehensive information would be availabl e on all cases, but in practice efforts Post-Approval Safety Data Management:  Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting    8 should be made to seek additional inform ation on selected reports, including second â hand reports (see Attachment, Recommended Key Data Elements, of this guideline).   In any scheme to optimize the value of follow-up, the first consideration should be  prioritization of case reports by importance.   The priority for follow-up should be as  follows: cases which are 1) serious and unexp ected, 2) serious and expected, and 3)  non-serious and unexpected. In addition to  seriousness and expectedness as criteria,  cases âof special interestâ also deserve extra attention as a high priority (e.g., ADRs  under active surveillance at the request of the regulators), as well as any cases that  might lead to a labeling change decision.  Follow-up information should be obtained, via a telephone call and/or site visit and/or  a written request.  The company should prov ide specific questions it would like to  have answered.  Follow-up methods should be tailored towards optimizing the collection of missing information.  Writte n confirmation of details given verbally  should be obtained whenever possible.  In exceptional circumstances, if requests for  information have been refused by the reporter,  a regulatory authority might be able to  assist an MAH in obtaining follow-up data.  To facilitate the capture of clinically relevant and complete information, use of a  targeted questionnaire/specific form is encour aged, preferably at the time of the initial  report.  Ideally, healthcare professionals with thorough pharmacovigilance training  and therapeutic expertise should be involved  in the collection and the direct follow-up  of reported cases (particularly those of medical significance).  For serious ADRs, it is  important to continue follow-up and re port new information until the outcome has  been established or the condition is stabilized.  How long to follow up such cases is a  matter of judgment.  It is important that at the time of the original report, sufficient details about the  patient and reporter be collecte d and retained to enable future investigations, within  the constraints imposed by local data privacy laws.  5.4.1 Pregnancy Exposure  MAHs are expected to follow up all pregnanc y reports from healthcare professionals  or consumers where the embryo/foetus could have been exposed to one of its medicinal  products.  When an active substance, or on e of its metabolites, has a long half-life,  this should be taken into account when considering whether a foetus could have been  exposed (e.g., if medicinal products taken before the gestational period should be  considered).    5.5 How to Report   The CIOMS I form has been a widely acce pted standard for expedited adverse event  reporting.  However, no matte r what the form or format used, it is important that  certain basic information/data elements, when available, be included with any  expedited report, whether in a tabular or narrative presentation.  It is recommended that the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) be used for coding  medical information.  The standards for el ectronic submission of Individual Case  Safety Reports (ICSRs), according to the ICH E2B/M2 guidelines, should be  implemented.   The listing in the Attachment of this guideline addresses those data elements  regarded as desirable; if all relevant el ements are not available at the time of  expedited reporting, efforts should be made to obtain them.

Introduction  The entry into f orce of the new legislation on p harmacovigilance in July 2012,  established legal   requirements f or competent authorities in the Member States  and the European Medic ines agency  (the  Agency ) and marketing  authorisation holders to perform audits of their p harmacovigilance systems  [DIR Art 101(2), Art 104(2) , REG Art 28f], including risk  based audits of their quality systems [IR Art  13 (1), Art 17 (1) ].  For the purposes of this M odule reference to pharmacovigilance audit(s) and pharmacovigilance audit  activity(ies)  are deemed to include pharmacovigilance system audits and audit(s) of the quality system   for pharmacovigilance activities .    The minimum requirements of the ph armacovigilance systems and the quality system are set out in  the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012 (IR) on the performance of  pharmacovigilance activities provided for in Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Directive 2001/83/EC.   Risk-based audits of the pharmacovigilance system  should cover all areas listed in Directive  2001/83/EC (DIR) and Regulation (EC) 726/2004 (REG) . The specificities of the risk -based audits of  the quality system [for pharmacovigilance activities] are as described in t he Implementing Measures  [IR Art 8,10,  11,12,13(1) for marketing authorisation holders, and IR  Art 8,14,15,16,17(1) for  the  competent authorities in Member States and the Agency ].  The overall description and objectives of pharmacovigilance systems  and qual ity systems  for  pharmacovigilance activities are referred to in GVP Module I , while the specific pharmacovigilance  processe s are described in each respective Module of GVP.    In this Module, all applicable legal requirements are referenced in the way explai ned in the GVP  Introductory Cover Note  and are usually identifiable by the modal verb âshallâ. Guidance for the  implementation of legal requirements is provided using the modal verb âshouldâ.   This Module provides guidance on planning and  conducting the legally required audits , and in respect  of the operation of the EU regulatory network,  the role, context and management of p harmacovigilance  audit activity.  This Module is intended to  facilitate the performance of  pharmacovigilance audits ,  especially to promote harmonisation, and encourage c onsistency and simplification  of the audit  process.  The principles in this Module are aligned with internationally accepted auditing  standard s,  issued by relevant international auditing standardisation organisations1 and su pport a risk -based  approach  to pharmacovigilance audits.   Section IV.B. outlines  the general structures and processes that should  be followed  to identif y the most  appropriate pharmacovigilance  audit engagements  and describes the steps which can be undertake n  by marketing authorisation holders, competent authorities in Member States and the European  Medicines Agency, to plan, conduct and report upon an individual p harmacovigilance  audit  engagemen ts. This Section also provides an outline  of the general quality  system and record  management practices for pharmacovigilance audit processes.   Section IV.C. provides an outline of the operation of the EU network in respect of p harmacovigilance  audits .                                                        1 For m ore details regarding The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) see www.theiia.org ; the International Organisation for  Standardisation  (ISO) see www.iso.org ; Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) see www.isaca.org ;  The International Auditing and Ass urance Standards Board (IAASB)  see www.ifac.org ; The International Organisation of  Supreme Audit Institutions  (INTOSAI) see  www.issai.org .

Terminology   Audit, Audit findings, Audit plan, Audit prog ramme, Audit recommendations,   Upper management : see in GVP Annex I .  Auditee: [entity]  being audited (ISO 19011 (3.7) 2).  Compliance : Conformity and adherence to policies, plans, procedures, laws, regulations, contracts, or  other requirements  (IIA Internati onal Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing2).   Control(s): Any action taken by management and other parties to manage risk and increase the  likelihood that established objectives and goals will be achieved. Management plans, organises, and  directs the performance of sufficient actions to provide reasonable assurance that objectives and goals  will be achieved (IIA International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing2).  Evaluation (of audit activities) :  Profession al auditing bodies promote compliance with standards,  including in quality assurance of their own activities, and codes of conduct, which can be used to  address adequate fulfilment of the organisationâs basic expectations of Internal Audit activity and its   conformity to internationally accepted auditing standards.   Finding(s):  see Audit findings   Head of the organisation : see Upper management   Auditors â independence:  The freedom from conditions that threaten objectivity or the appearance of  objectivity. Such threats to objectivity must be managed at the individual auditor, engagement, functional and organisational levels (IIA International Standards for the Professional Practice of  Internal Auditing 2).  Internal Control: Internal control is an integral process that is  effected by an entityâs management and  personnel and is designed to address risk and provide reasonable assurance that in pursuit of the  entityâs mission, the following general objectives are being achieved: executing orderly, ethical, economical, efficient and effective operations, fulfilling accountability obligations, complying with  applicable laws and regulations and safeguarding resources against loss, misuse and damage (for  further information refer to COSO standards).

Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module IV  (Rev 1)   EMA/228028/2012  Rev 1  Page 5/12   IV.B. Structures and processes   IV.B.1. Pharmacovigilance audit  and its objective   Pharmacovigilance audit activities  should  verify, by examination and evalu ation of objective evidence,  the appropriateness and effectiveness of the implementation and operation  of a pharmacovigilance  system , including  its quality system for pharmacovigilance activities .  In general , an audit is a systematic, disciplined, independent and documented process for obtaining  evidence and evaluating the evidence objectively to determine the extent to which the audit criteria  are fulfilled , contributing to the improvement of risk management, control and governance process es.3  Audit eviden ce consists of records, statements or other information, which are relevant to the audit  criteria and verifiable. Audit criteria  are, f or each audit objective, the standards of performance and  control against which the auditee and its activities will be as sessed . In the context of  pharm acovigilance, audit criteria should  reflect the requirements for the pharmacovigilance system ,  including its quality system for pharmacovigilance activities,  as found in the legislation and guidance .  IV.B.2 . The risk-based ap proach to p harmacovigilance  audits   A risk -based approach is one that uses techniques to determine the areas of risk , where risk is defined  as the probability of an event occurring  that will have an impact on the achievement of objectives ,  taking account of  the severity of its outcome and/or likelihood of non-detection by other methods.  The  risk-based approach to audits focuses on the areas of highest risk to the organisation âs  pharmacovigilance system , including its quality system for pharmacovigilance activities .  In the context  of pharmacovigilance, the risk to public health is of prime importance.  Risk can be assessed at the  following stages :   â¢ strategic level audit planning resulting in an audit strategy  (long term approach), which should be  endorsed by upper management ;  â¢ tactical level audit planning resulting in an  audit programme,  setting audit objectives , and the   extent and boundaries, often termed as scope , of the audits in that programme ; and   â¢ operational level audit planning resulting in an audit plan for individual audit engagements ,  prioritising audit tasks based on risk  and utilising risk -based sampling and testing approaches , and  reporting of audit findings in line with their  relative risk level  and audit recommendations in line  with the suggested grading system ( see IV.B.2.3.1.).   Risk assessment should be documented appropriately for the strategic, tactic al and operational  planning of p harmacovigilance audit activity in the organisation  (see IV.B.2.1 ., IV.B.2.2 . and IV.B.2.3 .  respectively) .  IV.B. 2.1.Strategic  level audit p lanning   The audit strategy is a h igh level statement of how the a udit activities  will be delivered over a period of  time, longer than the annual programme, usually for a period of 2-5 years . The audit strategy  include s  a list of audits that could reasonably be  performed.  The audit strategy  is used to outline  the areas  highlighted for audit, the audit topics as well as the methods an d assumptions (including e.g. risk  assessment) on which the audit p rogramme is based .                                                    3 Benchmarking, reviews of qualifications , risk assessment questionnaires, surveys or other activities in which evidence of  fulfilment of pharmacovigilance requirements is not independently obtained and evaluated, would not be regar ded as an  audit.    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module IV  (Rev 1)   EMA/228028/2012  Rev 1  Page 6/12   The audit strategy  should cover  the governance, risk management and internal controls of  all parts of  the pharmacovigilance system including:   â¢ all pharmacovigilance processes and tasks;   â¢ the quality system  for pharmacovigilance activities;   â¢ interactions and interfaces wit h other departments , as appropriate;   â¢ pharmacovigilance activities conducted by affiliate d organisations or activities  delegated to another  organisation (e.g. regional reporting centres, MAH affiliates or third parties , such as contract  organisations and ot her vendors ).  This is a non -prioritised, non -exhaustive list of examples of risk factors that could be consider ed for the  purposes of a risk assessment :  â¢ changes to legislation and guidance ;  â¢ major re -organisation  or other re -structuring of the p harmacovigil ance system , mergers,  acquisitions (specifically for marketing authorisation holders , this may lead to a significant increase  in the number of products for which the system is used) ;  â¢ change in key managerial function (s);  â¢ risk to a vailability of adequately trained and experienced pharmacovigilance staff, e.g. due to  significant turn -over of staff,  deficiencies in training processes, re -organisation , increase in  volumes of work;   â¢ significant changes to the system sin ce the time of a previous audit,  e.g. introd uction  of a new  database (s) for p harmacovigilance  activities or of a significant upgr ade to the existing database(s),   changes to processes and activities in order to address new or amended regulatory requirements ;  â¢ first medicinal product on the market  (for a marketing authorisation holder);   â¢ medicinal p roduct (s) on the market with  specific risk minimisation measures or other specific   safety  conditions such as requirements for additional monitoring;   â¢ criticality of the  process, e.g.:  â for competent authorities:  how critical is the area/process to proper functioning of the  pharmacovigilance system and the overall objective of safeguarding public healt h;  â for marketing authorisation holders: how critical is the area/process to proper functioning of  the pharmacovigi lance system. When deciding when to audit an affiliate or third party, the  marketing authorisation holder should consider the nature and criticality of the  pharmacovigilance activities that are being performed by an affiliate or third party on behalf of  the marketing authorisation holder, in addition to considering the other factors included in this  list;  â¢ outcome of previous audits , e.g. has the area/process ever been audited (if not, then this may  need to be prioritised depending on criticality) ; if the ar ea/process has previously been audited,  the audit findings are a factor to consider when deciding when to re -audit the area/process,  including the implementation of a greed actions;   â¢ identified procedural gaps relati ng to specific areas/processes;   â¢ other information relating to compliance  with legislation and guidance, for example :   Guidel ine on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module IV  (Rev 1)   EMA/228028/2012  Rev 1  Page 7/12   â for competent authorities: information from compliance  metrics (as described in the  Commission Implementing Regulation on the Performance of Pharmacovigilance Activities  Provided fo r in Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Directive 2001/83/EC ), from complaints,   from external sources , e.g. audits/ assessments of the competent authority conducted by  external bodies ;  â for marketing authorisation holders: information from compliance metrics (a s described in the  Commission Implementing Regulation on the Performance of Pharmacovigilance Activities  Provided for in Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Directive 2001/83/EC ), from inspections  (see  GVP Module III ), from complaints , from other external sour ces, e.g. audits ;  â¢ other organisational changes that could negatively impact on the area/process , e.g. if a change  occurs to a support function (such as information technology support) this could negatively impact  upon pharmacovigilance  activities.   IV.B. 2.2. Tactical level audit planning    An audit programme is a set of one or more audits planned for a specific timeframe,  normally for a  year.  It should be prepared in line with the long term audit strategy .  The audit programme should be  approved by upper ma nagement with overall responsibility for operational and governance structure .  The risk-based  audit programme should  be based on an appropriate risk assessment and should focus  on:  â¢ the quality system  for pharmacovigilance activities ;  â¢ critical pharmacovigil ance processes (see e.g. GVP Module I  and IR Art 11 , 15);   â¢ key control systems relied on for pharmacovigilance activities ;  â¢ areas identified as high risk , after controls have been put in place or mitigating action taken.   The risk -based audit programme shoul d also take into account historical areas with insufficient past  audit coverage , and high risk areas identified by  and/or specific requests from  management and/or  persons responsible for pharmacovigilance activities .  The audit programme document ation shoul d include a brief description of the plan for each audit to be  delivered, including an outline of scope  and objectives .  The rationale for the timing, periodicity and scope of the individual audits which form part of the audit  programme should be based on t he documented risk assessment.   However, r isk-based   pharmacovigilance audit(s) should be performed at regular intervals , which are in line with legislative  requirements .  Changes to the audit programme may happen and will require proper documentation.   IV.B.2.3. Operational level audit planning and reporting   IV.B.2.3. 1. Planning and fieldwork   The organisation should ensure that written procedures are in place regarding the planning and conduct of individual audits that will be delivered. Timeframes for all the steps required for the performance of an individual audit should be settled in the relevant audit related procedures, and the  organisation should ensure that audits are conducted in accordance with the written procedures , in line  with this GVP Module .   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module IV  (Rev 1)   EMA/228028/2012  Rev 1  Page 8/12   Individual p harmacovigilance audits should be undertaken in line with the approved risk -based audit  programme (see IV.B.2.2 .). When planning individual audits , the auditor identifies and assesses the  risks relevant to the area under review  and employs the m ost appropriate risk -based sampling and  testing methods , documenting the audit approach in an audit plan.   IV.B.2.3. 2. Reporting   The findings of the auditors should be documented in an audit report and should be  communicate d to  management in a timely manner . The a udit process should include mechanisms for communicat ing the  audit findings to the auditee and receiv ing feedback , and report ing the audit findings to management   and relevant parties , including those responsible for pharmacovigilance systems,  in accordance with  legal requirements and guidance on p harmacovigilance  audits . Audit findings should be reported in line  with their relative risk level and should be graded in order to indicate their relative criticality  to risks  impacting the  pharmacovigilance  system , processes and parts of processes.  The grading system  should be defined in the description of the quality system for  pharmacovigilance , and should take into  consideration the thresholds noted below which would be used in further reporting under th e legislation  as set out in IV.C.2 .:  â¢ critical  is a fundamental  weakness  in one or more pharmacovigilance processes  or practices that  adversely affects the  whole pharmacovigilance system  and/or  the rights, safety or well- being of  patients, or that poses a p otential risk to public health and/ or represents a serious violati on of  applicable regulatory requirements.    â¢ major  is a significant weakness in one or more  pharmacovigilance processes or practices, or a  fundamental weakness in part of one or more pharmaco vigilance processes or practices that is  detrimental to the whole process and/or could potentially adversely affect the rights, safety or  well-being of patients  and/or could potentially pose a risk to public health and/or represents a  violation of applicab le regulatory requirements which is however not considered serious.    â¢ minor is a weakness in the part of one or more p harmacovigilance processes or practices that is  not expected to adversely affect  the whole pharmacovigilance system or process and/or  the rights,  safety or well -being of patients .   Issues that need to be urgently addressed should be communicated in an expedited manner to the  auditeeâs  management and the upper management .  IV.B. 2.4. Action s based on audit  outcomes  and follow -up of audits   Actions referenced in this section of the guideline, i.e., immediate action, prompt action, action within a reasonable timeframe, issues that need to be urgently addressed, or communicated in an expedited  manner, are intended to convey timelines that are appropriate, relevant, and in line with the relative risk to the pharmacovigilance system.  Corrective and preventive actions to address critical and major  issues should be prioritised .  The precise timeframe for action(s) related to a given critical finding, for   example, may differ depending on  nature of findings and  the planned action(s).   The management of the organisation is responsible  for ensuring that the organisation has a mechanism  in place to adequately address the issues arising from p harmacovigilance  audits. Actions should include  root cause analysis and impact analysis of identified audit findings and preparation of a corrective and preventive action plan, where appropriate.   Upper  management and those charged with governance, should ensure that effecti ve action is  implemented to address the audit findings.  The implementation of agreed actions should be monitored   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module IV  (Rev 1)   EMA/228028/2012  Rev 1  Page 9/12   in a systematic way, and the progress of implementation should be communicated on a periodic basis  proportionate to the planned actions to upper management.   Evidence of completion of actions should be recorded  in order to document that issues raised during  the audit have been addressed.    Capacity for follow -up audits should be  foreseen  in the audit programme . They should be carried out  as  deemed necessary, in order to verify the completion of agreed actions.  [IR Art 13(2), Art 17(2)]   IV.B. 3. Quality system and record management practices   IV.B. 3.1. Competence of auditors and quality  management of audit   activities   IV.B.3. 1.1. Independence  and objec tivity  of audit work and auditors   The organisation should assign the specific responsibilities for the pharmacovigilance audit activities.  Pharmacovigilance audit activities should be independent.  The organisationâs management should  ensure this  independen ce and objectivity  in a structured manner and  document this.   Auditors  should be free from interference in determining the scope of auditing, performing  pharmacovigilance audits and communicating  audit results .  The main rep orting line should be  to the  upper management with overall responsibility for operational and governance structure that allows the  auditor(s) to fulfil their responsibilities  and to provide independent, objective  audit opinion.  Auditors  can consult with technical experts , personnel involved in pharmacovigilance processes,  and with the  person responsible for pharmacovigilance; however auditors should maintain a n unbiased attitude that  allows them to perform audit work  in such a manner that they have an honest belief in their work  product a nd that no significant quality compromises are made.  Objectivity  requires auditors not to  subordinate their judg ement on audit matters to that of others.   IV.B. 3.1.2. Qualifications, skills and experience of auditors and continuing professional  development   Auditors should  demonstrate  and maintain proficiency in terms of the knowledge, skills and abilities  required to effectively conduct and/or participate in pharmacovigilance audit activities . The p roficiency   of audit team members  will have been gained thro ugh a combination of education, work experience  and training and , as a team, should cover  knowledge, skills and abilities in:   â¢ audit principles, procedures and techniques ;  â¢ applicable laws, regulations and other requirement s relevant to p harmacovigilance ;  â¢ pharmacovigilance  activities, processes and  system(s);   â¢ management system (s);  â¢ organisational system (s).  IV.B.3. 1.3. Evaluation of the quality of audit activities   Evaluation of  audit work can be undertaken by means of ongoing and periodic assessment of all aud it  activities, auditee feedback and self -assessment of audit activities (e.g. quality assurance  of audit  activities, compliance to code of conduct, audit programme, and audit procedures) .   Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module IV  (Rev 1)   EMA/228028/2012  Rev 1  Page 10/12   IV.B.3. 2. Audits undertaken by outsourced audit service providers   Ultimate responsibility for the operation and effectiveness  of the p harmacovigilance system resides  within the organisation ( i.e. within the Agency , competent authority  or marketing authorisation  holder ). Where the organisation decides to use an outsourced audit s ervice provider to implement the  pharmacovigilance audit requirements on the basis of this GVP M odule and perform pharmacovigilance  audits :  â¢ the requirements and preparation of the audit risk assessment, the audit strategy and audit  programme and individual engagements should be specified to the outsourced service providers,  by the organisation, in writing ;  â¢ the scope, objectives and procedural requirements for the audit should be specified to the  outsourced  service provider, by  the organisation, in wr iting;   â¢ the organisation should obtain and document assurance of the independence and objectivity of  outsou rced service providers;   â¢ the outsourced audit service provider should also follow th e relevant parts of this GVP Module.   IV.B.3. 3. Retention of audit r eports   Retention of the audit report and evidence of completion of action needs to be in line with the  requirements stipulated in  GVP Module I .  IV.C. Pharmacovig ilance audit policy framework and  organisational structure    IV.C.1. Marketing authorisation hol ders in the EU   IV.C.1.1. Requirement to perform an audit   The marketing authorisation holder in the EU is required to perform regular risk-based  audit(s) of their  pharmacovigilance syste m [DIR Art 104(2)], including audit(s) of its quality system to ensure that the  quality system complies with the quality system requirements [ IR Art 8,10,11,12,13(1)].  The dates  and results of audits and follow -up audits shall be documented [ IR Art 13(2)]   See IV.C.2. for further details of the requirements for audit reportin g by the marketing authorisation  holder.   IV.C.1.1. 1. The qu alified person responsible for p harmacovigilance in the EU (QPPV)   The responsibilities of the QPPV in respect of audit are provided in GVP Module I .  Furthermore, the  QPPV should receive pharmacovi gilance audit reports, and provide information  to the auditors  relevant  to the risk assessment, including knowledge of status of corrective and preventive actions.    The QPPV should be notified of any audit findings relevant to the pharmacovigilance system  in the EU,  irrespective of where the audit was conducted.    Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)  â Module IV  (Rev 1)   EMA/228028/2012  Rev 1  Page 11/12   IV.C.1.2. Competent authorities in Member States and the E uropean  Medicines Agency   IV.C.1. 2.1. Requirement to perform an audit   The Agency shall perform regular independent audits of its p harmacovig ilance tasks [REG Art 28f]  and  competent authorities in Member States shall  perform a regular audit of their p harmacovigilance  system  [DIR Art 101(2)].    Included in their obligation to perform audits of their pharmacovigilance  system/tasks, competent auth orities in the Member States and the Agency shall perform risk -based  audits of the quality system as well , at regular intervals according to a common methodology to ensure  that the quality system complies with the requirements [ IR Art 8,14,15,16,17(1)] .   The dates and  results of audits and follow -up audits shall be documented [ IR Art 17(2)].  IV.C.1.2. 2. Common methodology   In order to have a useful audit system, all audits at the competent authorities in the Member States  and the European Medicines Agency s hould have a common g round in terms of methodology. This  should ensure  harmonised planning, implementation and reporting by every competent authority in  Member States and at the Agency .  IV.C.1.2.3 . The Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC)   The mandate of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) shall cover all aspects of  the risk management of the use of medicinal products for human use , having due regard to  the design  and evaluation of  pharmacovigilance audit s [REG Art 61a(6)].   IV.C.2. Requirements  for audit reporting in the EU   IV.C.2 .1. Reporting by the marketing authorisation holder   The marketing authoris ation holder shall place a note concerning critical and major audit findings of  any audit relating to the pharmacovigilance s ystem i n the p harmacovigilance system master file  (PSMF)  (see GVP Module II ). Based on the audit findings,  the marketing authorisation holder shall   ensure that an appropriate plan  detailing corrective and preventative action  is prepared and  implemented. On ce the corrective and preventive actions  have been fully implemented, the note may  be removed [DIR Art 104(2) , IR Art 13(2) ]. Objective evidence is required in order that any note of  audit findings can be removed from the pharmacovigilance system master fi le (see GVP Module II).   The marketing authorisation h olders should ensure that  a list of all scheduled and completed audits is  kept in the annex to the pharmacovigilance system master file (IR Art 3(5))  and that they comply with   reporting commitments in line with the legislation, GVP guidance and their internal reporting policies.    The dates and results of audits and follow -up audits shall be documented [ IR Art 13(2)].  IV.C. 2.2. Reporting by competent authorities in Member States and the  Agency   Competent a uthorities  in Member States, and the Agency  should ensure that  they comply with   reporting commitments in line with  the legislation, GVP guidance and  their internal reporting policies.

Introduction   The operation of the full Medical Literature Monitoring (MLM)  service started  on 1 September  2015 and  was extended on 1 June 2020  and cover s active chemical substance groups  1-309, and herbal  substance groups 1 -100. The MLM Service was further extended on 1 April 2024 to include searching in  MEDLINE. The substance groups are published at the following link âMedical literature monitoring:  substance and herbal substance groups â on the dedicated MLM webpage .  This document outlines the search strategy for each of the substance groups as part of the Agencyâs  activities set out in Article 27 of Regulation (EC) 726/2014  used to undertake the daily se arch in  EMBASE . Please note that âdailyâ refers to calendar days with the exception of weekends (Saturday and  Sunday) .   The search strategy was created in EMBASE and uses the syntax and terminology of the EMBASE  search engine.     II. General Principles   â¢ The search for each substance group has been prepared to be exhaustive in line with the  requirements of the Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP) Module VI â Collection,  management and submission of reports of suspected adverse reactions to medicinal products (Rev  2), hereafter referred to as â GVP module VI â, chapter VI.App2.3.2 .  â¢ The most comprehensive search strategy targeted to achieve precise results as regards the areas  to be monitored have been defined for each substance group and for the literature reference  databases as outlined in the  description of the journal/reference databases used  as published at  the dedicated MLM webpage.   â¢ The search parameters aim to identify  and retrieve :  â suspected adverse reactions originating from spontaneous reports and solicited reports in  humans (see GVP module VI, chapter VI.B.1.1. and VI.B.1.2.) and   â special situations such as lack of therapeutic efficacy, use of a medicinal product during  pregnancy and breastfeeding, use of a medicinal product in a paediatric or elderly population,  reports of off -label use, misuse, abuse, overdose, medication error as well as occupational  exposure associated with suspected adverse reactions.   The exact scope is  defined in the âDetailed guide regarding the monitoring of medical literature  and the entry of relevant information into the EudraVigilance database by the European  Medicines Agency â (hereafter referred to as âDetailed Guideâ) .  â¢ Each search strategy  is routinely reviewed and updated where necessary to improve search  precision or to align with any updates to the thesaurus used for indexing in the journal/reference  databses used.   â The first update to the safety filter was made on 01 October 2015. The previous  version is  contained in Chapter V: Search  string versions ,  â The second update was made on 01 June 2020. It only affect ed substance groups 25, 39, 71,  76, 201 , 297 and 301 â 309,     European Medicines Agency MLM Service EMBASE search strategy    EMA/517840/2015    Effective date: 1 April 2024 Page 13/368   â The third update was made on 01 April 2021. It only affected substance groups 25, 39, 71, 76,  201, 297 and 301 â 309,  â The fourth update was made on 20 May 2022, correcting the substances in group 310,   â The fifth update was made on 1 April 2024 , restoring the search strategy from version 3.0 to  2.0 for substance groups 25, 39, 71, 76, 201 , 297 and 301 â 309 and also correcting the  substance and brand name terms for substance group 333 .  â¢ Each search strategy is applied to the journal/reference databases  according to the predefined  periodicity  as outlined in the Detailed Guide .  â¢ Each search is conducted with a  âhuman â filter and is limited to articles published in the current or  previous year .  â Searching is performed without enabling language filters to retrieve all articles that meet the  search criteria.   â¢ The search strategy for each subs tance group is constituted of multiple componen ts such as the   International Nonproprietary Name (INN)  as well as alternative names (variants) for the  substances based on the information available in the Extended EudraVigilance Medicinal Product  Dictionary (xEV MPD).   Alternative names include medicinal product names (brand names) based on the information  submitted by marketing authorisation holders in accordance with Article 57(2), second  subparagraph of Regulation (EC) 726/2004 as well as variants for medicinal product names that  have been reported in ICSRs to EudraVigilance.   â¢ The additional core search strategy  (version 2.0),  applied  to all substance groups, in order to  increase the precision of the search in each active substance group in Boolean format is as follows:   AND ('adverse drug reaction'/exp OR adverse:de,ab,ti OR 'side effect':de,ab,ti OR 'side  effects':de,ab,ti OR 'side effect':lnk OR 'drug overdose'/exp OR overdos*:de,ab,ti OR 'drug  misuse'/exp OR misus*:de,ab,ti OR 'drug abuse'/exp OR 'substance abuse'/exp OR abus*:de,ab,ti  OR 'pregnancy'/exp OR pregnan*:de,ab,ti OR 'pregnancy complications'/exp OR 'lactation'/exp OR  'breast feeding'/exp OR ('milk human'/exp AND 'secretion'/exp) OR 'fertility'/exp OR  'reproduction'/exp OR 'fetus'/exp OR 'embryo'/exp OR terat*:de,ab,ti OR 'drug efficacy'/exp OR  'drug withdrawal'/exp OR 'medication error'/exp OR 'death'/exp OR death*:de,ab,ti OR  fatal*:de,ab,ti OR 'drug interactions'/exp OR 'drug interaction'/exp OR 'carcinogenicity'/exp OR  carcinogen*:de,ab,ti OR mutagen*:de,ab,ti OR 'off label drug use'/exp OR 'occupational  exposure'/exp OR 'toxicity'/exp OR toxic*:de,ab,ti OR pharmacotox*:de,ab,ti OR  neurotox*:de,ab,ti OR cardiotox*:de,ab,ti OR nephrotox*:de,ab,ti OR immunotox*:de,ab,ti OR  hepatotox*:de,ab,ti OR cytotox*:de,ab,ti OR immunocytotox*:de,ab,ti OR 'intoxication'/exp OR  'congenital disorder'/exp OR 'drug treatment failure'/exp OR 'case report'/exp OR 'case  reports':de,ab,ti OR 'environmental exposure'/exp OR 'treatment contraindication'/exp OR 'drug  contraindication'/exp OR 'injury'/exp OR suicide:de,ab,ti OR 'poisoning'/exp OR 'drug  tolerance'/exp/mj OR 'treatment failure'/exp/mj OR 'drug resistance'/exp/mj OR 'substance - related disorders'/exp OR 'treatment failure'/exp OR 'drug resistance'/exp OR 'drug  resistance':lnk) AND [humans]/lim   Search string glossary:   â¢ *: wildcard â anything following that string   â¢ ab: abstract   â¢ de: index term   â¢ lim: limiter   â¢ lnk: subheading      European Medicines Agency MLM Service EMBASE search strategy    EMA/517840/2015    Effective date: 1 April 2024 Page 14/368   â¢ mj: major focus of article   â¢ ti: article title   â¢ The term âadverse drug reactionâ is linked to the term adverse event in the literature reference  database thesaurus.

Information is provided about the safety of these substances to patients, healthcare providers, and the general public as soon as possible. Pharmacovigilance includes reviewing the development, management, and introduction of pharmaceuticals. It is probably the most tightly regulated part of the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmacovigilance aims to identify, detect, assess, and report any adverse drug reaction (ADR) related to pharmaceutical products. In the United States, the European Union, and other parts of the world, regulatory requirements have emerged that have grown in diversity and nuance. These requirements include systematic monitoring and review of medical literature, including comprehensive screening of medical journals for adverse drug reactions, which remain on the rise. Having a robust pharmacovigilance system is paramount for a manufacturer, and any deficiencies can have an adverse effect on patient safety. Literature monitoring includes published articles, articles, and reviews in indexed or non-indexed journals, any content posted anywhere online, posters and conference abstracts, etc. Holders of a Marketing Authorization (MA) must monitor global and local literature throughout the duration of that authorization, regardless of the availability of the product on the market1. Regulatory reports, clinical trial reports, literature reports, license partner reports, and spontaneous reports all serve as sources of data for deeper analysis of regulatory reporting, signal detection, and aggregate reporting. The individual safety report (ICSR) is valuable for developing risk assessments. It is incumbent upon holders of marketing authorizations to stay up-to-date on potential publications (including ahead of print articles) by reviewing widely used reference databases (e.g., Medline, Embase, Excerpta Medica) every week 2 . Adverse events that meet the criteria for the ICSR are handled per regulatory guidelines on handling and reporting adverse events. When a relevant article has been identified, it will be further screened to determine if it meets the four essential criteria for consideration for Individual case safety report (ICSR) and adverse event reporting: 1) identified source, 2) company product, 3) patient, 4) adverse event 3 . Any analysis regarding the safety profile of a product should be based on scientific and medical publications. Literature searches and monitoring are primarily intended to identify single case reports of adverse effects and to track any changes in benefit-risk profiles associated with the drug, particularly when new safety signals safety concerns arise 4 . Literature Monitoring: An Overview of Best Practices When the foundation is compromised, a process can result in a cascade of unintended repercussions. Therefore, an unbiased search is vital for monitoring medical literature accurately and efficiently. The growing volume of data has made it more critical to get the best results without introducing unwanted data. The literature monitoring process is usually characterized by two major challenges, which can be overcome. The first challenge is to come up with the right search strategy, and the second is to deal with duplication. Drug manufacturers must often track hundreds of drugs at once. So how can literature monitoring be accurate and valid? Optimal Search Strategy Design and Database Selection Regulatory authorities require marketing authorization holders to conduct medical literature surveillance at least weekly according to the GVP module VI and based on the required frequency as described by the local regulatory authorities, both for globally indexed literature databases and locally (non-indexed) literature journals 5 . When developing search strategies, it is important to consider ICSRs, aggregate reports, and any potential safety-related information. Therefore, it is essential to develop and progressively improve search strategies to limit the risk of overlooking relevant ADR information. Specifically, to retrieve all relevant records, query terms must be highly recallable and carefully crafted to retrieve maximum publications reporting any safety concerns about the product in question. The database must be comprehensive and meet minimum standards to ensure that safety-critical signals are not missed. Pharmacovigilance searchers typically utilize at least two databases, usually three or more, because having access to multiple databases increases their recall-finding capabilities, ensuring more coverage. Implement a search approach that balances the need for accuracy and precision. For example, 1) use several Boolean operators, 2) browse a thesaurus of terms, 3) perform proximity search, and 4) incorporate abbreviations to recall results. Using the most recent thesaurus update will ensure accuracy and compliance 6 . As part of the local literature review, it is recommended to identify the non-indexed journals published locally and to screen those in either an online or print format depending on their availability. There are a few local regulatory agencies that recommend performing local literature searches in a few databases that are locally approved. The MAH handles any publications identified as containing information in local languages in accordance with the translation process established within the institution. Industry best practice calls for constant review of search terms and updating them based on safety-related updates pertaining to the products. A GOLD standard data set of records is used to validate the modified search strategies. It is recommended to review your search strategy annually and make amendments as necessary 7 . EMA hosts a robust system for medical literature monitoring. Thousands of records are added daily. It is generally the responsibility of marketing authorization holders to monitor medical literature and report individual cases of suspected adverse reactions into EudraVigilance and national safety databases 8 . They are not required to monitor or report suspected adverse reactions for active substances to EudraVigilance for substances covered by EMAâs service 9 . Duplicate Data Management Scientific publications and medical literature are abundant with sources and references, so itâs likely that the same publication could be indexed in multiple formats across a variety of journals, which results in duplicate findings. This creates a whole series of redundant tasks and false signals regarding drug safety. It leads to erroneous evaluations and, ultimately, compliance problems. Duplicate management processes, however, can solve this issue. Even though this is the best way of dealing with articles, it comes with a few challenges. There may be limitations to duplicate identification within the tool due to the presence of special characters, or it may be the case that the same study has been published across different journals or conference abstracts, making the process cumbersome. It is important to search multiple databases to capture multiple publications across different journals. Keeping track of previous searches will also facilitate the identification of duplicates. To identify duplicate publications, there should not be just a focus on the article title but also the authorâs name and, in some cases, the name of the study cited in the article. According to Article 107(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC, to avoid duplicate submissions of ICSRs, the holder of a marketing authorization must submit the ICSRs that are not already assessed or monitored by EMA through the Medical Literature Monitoring (MLM) services 10 . Service providers should use a standardized and well-established deduplication system, enabling them to confirm that they are not missing relevant references or creating duplicates inadvertently. Along with routine literature surveillance, MAH also conducts targeted literature searches, which are searches specifically designed to answer a specific research question. When conducting signal analysis, these searches are conducted to confirm or disprove the association between the adverse event and the product. Summary Pharmacovigilance involves a substantial amount of literature monitoring . The process of devising a solid search strategy could be challenging but is essential. A professional with the required skills, experience, and training will ensure adverse event-related safety information is never missed. It is necessary to develop and maintain search strategies, elicit ideas from different stakeholders, and develop approved and suitable strategies for the purpose at hand. It is critical to set up a thorough process to handle and manage duplicate articles. Regularly review search strategies, and ensure the documentation is robust to ensure the finest quality results. The following points can be considered to check whether the MAHâs literature monitoring systems meet quality standards; A drug safety expert with experience researching literature is needed. Conduct risk assessments to ensure that the search criteria are robust and relevant to the objective of the literature search. Conduct literature searches and evaluate the results for literature per regional requirements (Global and Local). Monitoring and reviewing the Eudravigilance Medical Literature Monitoring (MLM) system, managed by EMA, to identify ICSRs in the literature if your product is included in the active ingredient screened by EMA. The search string is reviewed and updated annually to optimize results.

Custom-Made Medical Devices: Are You Complying With EU Requirements? Your download is now available Download October 2, 2023 | By ClinChoice The world is progressing rapidly with advanced technologies and customization in almost every sector to meet human needs. In the healthcare sector, manufacturers of medical devices are actively involved in developing individualized products based on a patientâs needs. In some instances, over-the-counter/mass-produced medical devices, especially implantable devices, may not meet the specific patientâs requirements. Hence, custom-made devices (CMDs) are required to fulfill such individual patientsâ healthcare needs. This article summarizes current medical device regulatory requirements for CMDs in the European Union (EU), and how these requirements differ from other medical devices. What are Custom-made devices? The EU Medical Device Regulations (MDR) Article 2(3) defines a âcustom-made deviceâ as âany device that is specifically made following a written prescription of any person authorized by national law by virtue of that personâs professional qualifications, which gives, under that personâs responsibility, specific design characteristics, and is intended for the sole use of a particular patient exclusively to meet their individual conditions and needs.â Simply put, CMD is a medical device designed for a specific patient to suit their anatomical and physiological needs as prescribed by a legally authorized and qualified professional who provides specific design characteristics under their responsibility. For example, dental crowns/patient-specific dental guards, and prostheses are all CMDs, as pictured below ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1 : Examples of Custom-made devices However, not all medical devices tailored to meet an individual patient/userâs needs following an individualized written prescription by a qualified health professional are classified as CMDs. Personalized medical devices are often misconstrued as CMDs. There are two types of personalized medical devices: adaptable medical devices (such as spectacle frames and optical glasses) and patient-matched devices (such as orthopedic plates, mandibular plates, and externally worn orthoses). Even though these devices are intended to suit an individualâs needs, they are primarily mass-produced utilizing industrial manufacturing procedures to meet specific basic requirements, which are then further tailored to meet an individual patient/userâs need. In other words, a medical device based on standardized dimensions or designs not designed only for a particular individual and typically produced in a continuous production run or homogenous batch cannot be categorized as a CMD. How are the requirements for Custom-made devices different from other medical devices? Custom-made device manufacturers must comply with EU MDR before placing their products on the European market to ensure safety and performance to meet design standards. However, unlike other medical device manufacturers, CMD manufacturers must meet only specific regulations. Table 1 provides an overview of these specific MDR requirements applicable to CMDs compared to other medical devices. Table 1 : Regulatory requirements of Custom-made and other medical devices Reference: MDR Regulation (EU) 2017/745: Annex XIII (completely dedicated to custom-made devices); Annex IX: Conformity assessment based on a Quality Management System and assessment of technical documentation; Annex XI: Conformity assessment based on product conformity verification Conformity Assessment Procedure for Custom-made devices As per EU MDR requirements, all medical devices should comply with relevant regulatory requirements to ensure conformity. Figure 2 below describes the procedure for the conformity assessment of CMDs (such as notified body review) and compliance. The manufacturer must prepare a conformity assessment statement (as detailed in step 1, Figure 2 ) and keep up to date the documentation as stated in Annex XIII of MDR, including details such as manufacturing information, design, and performance of the device. The manufacturers of CMDs need to follow instructions for use when using CE-marked parts, components, or materials. In case of change in any physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of these parts during the manufacturing of the CMDs, compliance of the finished product to the general safety and performance requirements of MDR Annex I needs to be met. Custom-made devices are classified using a similar risk-based approach that includes invasiveness, intended use, and duration of use as other medical devices. Manufacturers of CMDs must provide a classification reason to the notified body and details on why the device is classified as a CMD. Figure 2 : Procedure for Custom-made devices MDR Compliance Timeline Extension Unlike MDD regulations, MDR mandates the involvement of a notified body in the conformity assessment of Class III custom-made implantable devices. As a benefit of the extension for the manufacturers, it is permissible to put Class III custom-made implantable devices into service or place them on the market until 26 May 2026 without needing certification from a notified body. However, for these devices, the manufacturer or their EU-authorized representative must submit a formal application for conformity assessment to the notified body by 26 May 2024. Moreover, a written agreement with the notified body must also be signed by 26 September 2024. All other classes of CMDs can be placed on the market after meeting all the applicable MDR requirements and drawing a statement as per Annex XIII of MDR. Transitioning from MDD to MDR is an ongoing challenge for many manufacturers wanting to keep their existing medical devices available in the EU market. At ClinChoice, we take great pleasure in assisting you in fulfilling these regulatory requirements, including the preparation of clinical evaluation reports and other regulatory reports for your medical devices . We are here to support you with a team of proficient specialists to ensure you meet the MDR regulatory requirements for your CMDs and other medical devices without experiencing any hassle.

Currently clinical trials are designed to include patients who have run out of treatment options and are in their late stage of disease. Giving patients access to new treatment options at an earlier stage will improve the safety assessment of investigational drugs. Patients in this setting have a good performance status in comparison to the late stage setting where there can be ongoing and residual issues due to numerous lines of therapy prior to enrolling in a clinical trial. Focusing on treatment options at an earlier stage would allow sponsors to consider randomized controlled trials and other study designs including the adaptive design given the larger patient pool. From here, sponsors would be able to compare the existing standard of care with the new treatment options. This would include opening more treatment arms in their study protocols and lead to innovative study designs which move away from the traditional 3+3 design. The acceptance of this project provides the opportunity for additional treatment options and the improved survival of oncology patients. Advancing oncology therapy development Project FrontRunner is an initiative that will have tremendous impact on the way cancer research is conducted while also having the potential to unfold new cancer drug development. This project has the potential to increase the patient pool which would not only have impact on study enrollment, but also help sponsors to test the safety of their investigational product by examining in patients with better performance status over a longer period of time. In turn, this will lead to a better understanding of the safety profile. This seems to be a win-win situation for sponsors and patients as it results in faster clinical development and earlier access to innovative solutions. Key considerations during the transition process The scope of Project FrontRunner is tied to other OCE initiatives and early adopters will be the ones who benefit the most. However, it is expected that not all oncology trials will change to include patients in the early stages of their disease or in advanced metastatic settings and there will continue to be clinical trials in late settings. The sponsors will need to make changes in the way they do their pre-clinical research to support this initiative. This means that the investigational drugs that are about to begin their First in Human studies may not be able to make that switch immediately and there will be a lag period. As previously mentioned, this initiative will take traction as time progresses and the oncology research space will see the impact of the changes accordingly. Next steps in improving the standard of care As a result of Project FrontRunner, oncology clinical trials will move away from traditional study designs to innovative study designs in an effort to support different situations. Currently, most sponsors are trying to get academic institutions on board since these institutions have the types of patients who are needed to support enrollment on the study. With this initiative, the sponsors will need to make some adjustments in terms of expectations about site selection. This would mean sponsors not only need to look for academic sites but also community oncology practices to get the enrollment of patients in their clinical trials. As a result, this will help community practices who are investing in the clinical research infrastructure and in the training of their staff to support their site participation in clinical trials. From the sponsorâs perspective, this can lead to getting more sites on board and increasing the cost to perform the clinical study. Considering the way oncology clinical trials are evolving regarding precision medicine, emphasis on genomics, and other nuances to develop individualized treatment option for patients, it will get harder to find patients if sponsors are not receptive to the idea of having more sites on board in order to enroll the required patient types in their clinical studies. There is a give and take in this situation and the sooner this is realized the better it will be for the sponsor, the study sites, and oncology clinical research.

This document serves as a finalization to the FDAâs draft guidance issued in July 0f 2014 entitled â Informed Consent Information Sheet â and supersedes previously released guidance documents, including the FDAâs â A Guide to Informed Consent â, which was released in September of 1998. ICF Summary & Background It is not uncommon to hear informed consent referred to as the âinformed consent process â. This is because the signing of the Informed Consent Form (ICF) entails far more than just a signature. According to the FDA, the informed consent process begins with advertisements used to recruit subjects. For this reason, it is important that any information provided in such advertisements be consistent with the ICF document and contain only the information needed for a subject to confirm their interest and potential eligibility for the study. After identification of a potential subject, an investigator, or someone knowledgeable about the study and able to answer questions about the research, should hold a consent discussion with the subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), about the research to be conducted. Often times, this discussion is lengthy and can take place over a number of days, weeks, clinic visits or phone calls between the investigator and the subject. It requires adequate time for the subject to interpret the information presented and make an informed decision about their participation, along with time for the subject to ask questions. The ICF process does not end with subject signature and enrollment. In fact, the informed consent process continues throughout the length of the subjectâs participation, requiring investigators to share any new or updated safety information that has come to light. Requirements and Exceptions The process of informed consent and the ICF document must meet 21 CFR 50.20 requirements and include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25. However, there are some exceptions to this requirement, including certain life-threatening situations, military operations, or public health emergencies (21 CFR 50.23) or situations involving emergency research (21 CFR 50.24). The FDA does not limit the authority of a physician to provide emergency medical care to the extent the physician is permitted to do so under applicable Federal, State, or local law. ICF Recommendations Free of coercion and undue influence Information presented to the subject must be in a clear, concise manner, which does not hold false promises of benefit. Any payment made to subjects should be approved by the IRB as non-coercive. Understandable language Information provided to the subject, or their LAR, must be presented in a language understandable to the subject and at a level they can comprehend. Free of exculpatory language The ICF document must be free of any language that implies the investigator, sponsor, site or its agents are not liable for negligence. ICF Elements At a minimum, an ICF must include a description of the study, expected/potential risks and discomforts, expected/potential benefits, alternative procedures or treatments available to the patient, confidentiality principles, compensation and treatment in the event of injury, study contact information, and a statement of voluntary participation. Additional ICF elements may be applicable depending on the research to be conducted, according to 21 CFR 50.25(b). Such elements may include a statement of unforeseeable risk, involuntary termination of subjectâs participation, additional cost to subjects, consequences of a subjectâs decision to withdraw, providing significant new findings to subjects, and the approximate number of subjects involved in the study. Under 21 CFR 50.27, a short form may be used in a situation where the required elements of the ICF are presented orally, such as in a case where the subject or LAR is unable to read due to low literacy levels or visual impairment. Any information planned to be shared orally to support the use of a short form must be IRB approved. All applicable clinical trials must, per FDA requirement, include the following statement exactly as written: âA description of this clinical trial will be available on https://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. Law. This Web site will not include information that can identify you. At most, the Web site will include a summary of the results. You can search this Web site at any time.â Additional explanation may be provided, if deemed necessary. A copy of the ICF, preferably signed, should be given to the person who signed the consent form. For circumstances where the consent does not occur in-person, a wet-ink or electronic signature must be obtained and the signed ICF sent to the investigator by mail, delivered by the subject (at their next scheduled visit) or sent electronically. The subject or LAR is also responsible for entering the date of signature on the ICF. Certain circumstances, such as those involving no more than minimal risk, allow for the use of oral consent from a subject or their LAR, in which case no signature is required, and the consent process should be thoroughly documented in the subjectâs case history and maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3). IRB Responsibilities As it relates to the informed consent process, the IRB is responsible for review of all informed consent materials, including recruitment materials (e.g. advertisements) and supplemental materials (e.g. schedule of assessments) to ensure their compliance with 21 CFR 50.25. In their review, the IRB must ensure all materials are free from coercive language and undue influence (21 CFR 50.20 and 56.111(a)(4)). If the study involves vulnerable populations, the IRB must ensure adequate safeguards are in place. It is the IRBâs role to consider if subjects should be informed of any financial relationships or interests associated with the investigation. In case of conflicting financial interests, the IRB should ensure subjects are adequately protected. The planned process for consent should be submitted by the investigator to the IRB. The investigator should clearly state who will be responsible for conducting the consent process and what procedures will be followed. The IRB is authorized to observe or have a third party observe the consent process, as deemed necessary. Any new information about the research or changes to the study that may affect the rights or welfare of subjects must be presented to the IRB. The IRB is responsible for determining if a revised ICF is required based on the new information. If so, the amended ICF must be approved by the IRB before implementation by the investigator. The revised ICF should be marked with a clear identifier to distinguish between the different versions. Should a study be suspended, the IRB has the authority to require that information be provided to subjects if it adds to the protection of their rights and welfare. However, the IRB, sponsor and investigator have the shared responsibility of determining what information is shared. If a study is terminated, subjects should receive as much information as possible regarding the rationale behind the termination. Investigator Responsibilities The investigator is responsible for obtaining the informed consent. They may delegate this responsibility to another individual who is qualified by education, training and experience, though the investigator is ultimately responsible for oversight of the designated individual and ensuring the informed consent was obtained in accordance with 21 CFR part 50. The individual obtaining consent should be knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and have the appropriate training and credentials to be able to answer any questions posed by the subject or LAR. It is the investigatorâs responsibility to submit the planned process for obtaining the informed consent to the IRB for approval. Any material intended for subjects as part of the informed consent process must also be approved by the IRB. No materials, including the ICF, may be shared with potential subjects until the IRB has granted all necessary approvals. It is also the investigatorâs responsibility to submit any new information revealed during the course of the study to the IRB for approval before the changes are initiated within the conduct of the research. An exception to this rule may occur when necessary to prevent immediate harm to the subjects (21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). The investigator should consider including information related to financial relationships or interests within the consent form. For example, they may choose to disclose the source of funding for the study, information about a financial arrangement or interest of an institution or investigator and how it is being managed. If a potential or actual conflict of interest exists, the investigator should consider having another individual, who does not have a financial conflict of interest, be involved in the consent process or the investigator may choose to use independent monitoring for the consent process. Sponsor Responsibilities The sponsor may provide a template ICF to the investigator for use. However, the sponsor must make certain that the ICF is updated following any feedback from the FDA received on their IND or IDE application to satisfy the regulations at 21 CFR 50.25. Any modifications made to the ICF after initial IRB submission must be re-submitted and re-approved before starting the trial. If the investigator chooses to use the sponsorâs ICF template, it is the sponsorâs responsibility to ensure that any modifications made by the investigator satisfy 21 CFR 50.25 regulations. Should the local IRB return with significant modifications to the ICF, the sponsor is expected to share the changes with all investigators and their respective IRBs. The sponsor may choose to be present during the first procedure for an IND trial, whether it be to provide support to the investigator or to record study-related information for the experimental device. In this case, the sponsor should outline these activities in the informed consent form, particularly if the activities of the sponsor personnel will directly affect the subject(s). FDA Responsibilities The FDAâs role in reviewing informed consent materials is to consider the appropriate communication of anticipated risks and discomforts to the subjects, as well as other required elements as per 21 CFR 50.25. If the FDA determines that the informed consent documents are misleading or do not adequately explain the required information to the subjects, they may require further revisions to be made before the trial can proceed. For Investigational New Drugs (INDs) and Biologics, the FDA does not necessarily require the submission of the ICF with the IND, however they may request it if deemed necessary for the trial to proceed safely. Typically, the FDA will want to review the ICF if the investigation involves a known unusual or serious toxicity or risk to subjects, a vulnerable population, an unusual study design, if the study is a post marketing safety clinical trial required by the FD&C Act section 505(o) to assess serious risk, involves asking subjects to forgo or delay known effective treatment for the disease, or if the FDA has other confidential or proprietary information not readily available to the IRB. For Investigational Medical Devices which require an IDE, the sponsor must submit all informed consent documents to the FDA. The sponsor is required to correct any deficiencies noted by the FDA within the informed consent documents before the clinical trial can be initiated.

MDR requirements are significantly more extensive than the MDD: while the MDD comprises 23 Articles and 12 annexes over 60 pages, the MDR has 123 articles and 17 annexes over 175 pages. Therefore, to maintain or obtain CE certification, companies must meet MDR requirements to remain in compliance and keep their product on the EU market. Extension of the transition period By June 2022, it was clear that compliance with the transitional phase, which was set for May 26 th , 2024, was unlikely to occur since the market and industry faced numerous difficulties that would ultimately impact consumers. The biggest challenge was the availability and capacity of notified bodies (NB) accredited under MDR; post-Brexit, the EU no longer recognizes UK Notified bodies, eliminating their right to issue CE certificates, thus diminishing the number of Notified bodies available to help with the transition. Other contributing factors include lack of advanced preparation and planning by manufacturers due to uncertainties surrounding NB availability, EUDAMED, lack of trained resources, new compliance expectations imposed by MDR, e.g., additional safety and performance data, i.e., General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs), plausible reclassification of several devices into higher risk categories, among others. Hence, taking these concerns into account, on March 15 th, 2023, the EU enacted Regulation (EU) 2023/607, which provides a much-needed extension to the original MDR transitional provisions. The extensions only apply to devices that have not undergone significant change in design or intended use and do not present an unacceptable risk to users and patients, and for which manufacturers have taken the necessary steps to comply. The fact that the MDR transition period has been extended is good news for manufacturers, but there isnât really much time to relax. New MDR Compliance Timeline What should Manufacturers do? Manufacturers should have a valid MDD/AIMDD certificate on the MDR Date of application (May 26th, 2021) and completed the following by May 26th, 2024, to qualify for the extension: 1\. Implement a quality management system as outlined in MDR Article 10(9) and 2 . Formally lodge an application with a Notified Body for the device Note: QMS implementation by this timeline is exempted for Class III implantable custom-made devices The only exception to this would be if the competent authority has approved a derogation under Article 59 MDR or 54 IVDR. It is therefore imperative for continual business that manufacturers complete their due diligence, rather than assuming that their products will automatically be extended under the MDR if they comply with requirements after adoption. Failure to comply with the above timelines and regulations prevents the device qualification under this extension. ClinChoiceâs support and services MDRâs scope of change will necessitate effective project management to establish that tasks are properly completed on schedule. At ClinChoice, we provide services to expedite and simplify compliance achievement at any stage of the transition and compliance to help ensure our clients are not impacted from a business standpoint and that the transition process is seamless. Our experts use their skills to create a transition plan and see it through to completion by implementing best practices and leading project teams at each stage. Our support includes but is not limited to â meeting the checklist of MDR, classification review, gap assessment, setting up the clinical evaluation process, technical documentation compilation, post-market vigilance system establishment, assisting companies to qualify for extension timelines by lodging a formal application, and written agreement, among others.

Iâm really excited to know the skills one needs to acquire for writing related to medical devices! Senior Medical Writer (SMW) : Thatâs great, and welcome! Weâre happy to have you, and I hope I can answer any questions you might have. But I want you to remember two important things about medical writing for medical devices. As medical writers, we always need to ensure that the medical device is safe for a patient. In addition, it must perform as intended. But to get started, Iâd like to ask you a question. NI : Sure! SMW : Whatâs the first thing you think of when you hear â Medical writing for medical devices ? NI : Hmm â I think of an operation manual that comes with devices like a blood glucose monitor, a blood pressure monitor, and a sleep apnea machine. But beyond that, Iâm not sure of the specifics. SMW : Well, that falls under medical writing for medical devices, but thereâs much more to it! Letâs start at the ground level to ensure weâre on the same page moving forward. Before we get to medical writing for medical devices, letâs cover medical writing in general. NI : Sounds good! So, what is medical writing? SMW : Medical writing is a science and art involving the writing of scientific documents of different types for regulatory submissions, scientific/technical presentations, medical communication, medical journalism, and medical editing, among other needs for drugs, devices, combination products, biologics, and more. Examples of documents include literature reviews, clinical protocols, clinical investigation reports, clinical evaluation plans and reports, post-marketing surveillance plans and reports, periodic safety update reports, 510(k), and premarket approval applications. The writing projects are essential either to obtain regulatory approval for the device to be marketed or to maintain the device on the market in different countries. Once a medical device is approved for use, there is a periodic update of most of these technical documents throughout the deviceâs lifecycle. NI : I see. Then what are the specifics around medical writing for medical devices ? SMW : Medical writing for medical devices usually requires help from experienced professionals who understand the complexities of technical writing in a highly regulated environment. Medical writers need a basic understanding of clinical research, statistics to interpret clinical and non-clinical studies, challenges faced by the medical device industry, and regulations that govern the marketing of a device in a particular geographic location. A writer should be able to understand the importance of each document and the impact of wrong interpretation of any referred data on medical devices and their regulations. Besides, writers ensure their documents are grammatically correct and free of spelling and formatting errors. NI : Interesting. Whatâs the industry demand like for medical writers for medical devices currently? SMW : The demand for medical writing for medical devices has increased significantly in recent years due to a few key factors. Increased scrutiny from global regulators requiring additional or more detailed regulatory documentation requires a) Real-world evidence collection for all medical devices throughout their life cycle. It includes modern wearables, software as a medical device (SaMD), and other novel medical drug-device combination products b) Increased accessibility and channel-specific content for medical device documentation c) Clinical investigation for high-risk devices. In addition, companies are expanding the range of medical devices. A few examples include combination products and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) based software as a medical device, among others. As the demand for medical writing continues to grow steadily in the medical device market, many skilled medical writers have become available to help train aspiring individuals who would like to choose this career path and create a roadmap for their future. NI : Wow, thatâs really interesting! Iâm guessing there are different, even more, specialized types of medical writing for medical devices, too? SMW : Oh, sure! Medical writing involves writing different types of documents for different purposes and audiences , like: Medical journalism for the general public, written in simple, non-technical language. Educational content for physicians, such as textbooks, continuing medical education programs, presentations, and e-learning tools. Educational content for patients. Marketing materials and literature targeted at healthcare professionals, such as manuals, brochures, and handouts. Publication and presentation content, including journal articles, manuscripts, abstracts, and posters. Research documentation, including the clinical trial protocol, investigatorâs brochure, consent form, report, and proposal. Regulatory documents, including instructions for use, clinical evaluation plans, clinical evaluation reports, periodic safety update reports, 510(k)s, and premarket approval NI : So, different types of medical writing for medical devices are intended for a unique audience, from physicians, patients, the general public, and medical device manufacturers to regulators. That must mean that the language and the level of technical content must be appropriate for the respective audience . SMW : Thatâs exactly right. For example, documents for medical professionals and regulators are typically highly technical and include scientific data with detailed explanations. In contrast, documents intended for patients and the general public are written in laymanâs terms. NI : What about regulatory documents ? SMW : Documents for regulatory submission must fulfill a set format and structure with content guided by specific regulations or regulatory guidance documents. Changes in regulatory requirements and device specifications often require creating new or updated regulatory documents. These updates can be critical to ensuring patient safety and obtaining optimal results from a device . NI : This is enlightening! I had no idea there was so much complexity to medical writing and medical writing for medical devices specifically, but Iâm here to learn. Couldnât have asked for a better introduction! SMW : So happy to help get you started! Remember, medical writing for medical devices is a science and an art. It demands a deep understanding from different perspectives and a genuine aptitude for quality writing. Thorough knowledge of specific documents and a deep understanding of the therapeutic area is required as it is extremely critical to create scientifically accurate documents that meet regulatory requirements.

Definitions  ................................ ................................ .............................  10 43   44   Guideline on the non -clinical requirements for   radiopharmaceuticals    EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018  Page 3/10   Executive summary  45  This guideline describes the non -clinical data that need to be  submitted in relation to the non- 46  radioactive part of radiopharmaceuticals, in the context of applications for marketing authorisations or 47  clinical trials.  48  1.  Introduction (background)  49  The need for a guidance paper focusing specifically on the non -clinical te sting requirements for 50  radiopharmaceuticals has emerged since currently  there is no detailed guidance available. Therefore, in 51  addition to the general non -clinical requirements described in e.g. ICH M3(R2), ICH S9 and ICH S6(R1), 52  the principles for non -clinical data generation in support of the specific clinical uses of 53  radiopharmaceuticals are laid down in this guideline . 54  2.  Scope  55  This guideline covers  radiodiagnostics as well as radiotherapeutics,  and provides  guidance for a targeted 56  approach to assess pharmacology and safety of the non -radioactive part of a radiopharmaceutical . The 57  principles explained in this document address the non- clinical evaluation as prerequisite for a clinical 58  trial authorisation as well as for a marketing authoris ation applicat ion. According to the categorisation of 59  the "Guideline on radiopharmaceuticals" ( EMEA/CHMP/QWP/306970/2007)  "ready to use" 60  radiopharmaceuticals will be covered . However, some of the principles outlined in this guideline might 61  also apply to the non- radioact ive component of so called âkitsâ and non -radioactive chemical precursors. 62  The toxicity induced by the radiation of the radionuclide  (which for radio therapeutics is the wanted 63  property) is not addressed in this guideline , since radiation induced clinical toxicity is covered by 64  Directives of EURATOM  (Directive 2013/ 59/Euratom) . 65  3.  General principles  66  Scientific innovation and the ability to generate highly -targeted ligands led to the development of many 67  different types of radiopharmaceuticals which show a larg e variety of clinical uses. They may be used as 68  radiodiagnostic s for scintigraphy  imaging, for measurement of biodistribution or as radiotherapeutics 69  administered to humans only once or with a low frequency of repeated administrations at doses lacking 70  a measureable pharmaco logical effect.  One common feature is that many of these radiopharmaceuticals 71  are prepared in small -scale quantities for the use in exploratory trials and will not undergo a full 72  development  programme  aiming  to marketing authoris ation. However, like for other medicinal products, 73  the same principles of safety evaluation should apply prior to the use of radiopharmaceuticals in humans 74  in clinical trials as well as for marketing authoris ation purposes. Therefore, a non -clinical risk 75  assessment  in line with the respective legislation is needed prior to the first in human (FIH) 76  administration of a radiopharmaceutical  and subsequent clinical development . The risk assessment will 77  in general be covered in the non -clinical program me and will influenc e the risk mitigation plan included 78  in the clinical study protocol.  79  In the case of radiopharmaceuticals it has to be considered that they represent a special class of 80  pharmaceuticals due to their conjugated design  and radiolabel . They are composed of a no n-radioactive, 81  âcoldâ , part with a radionuclide attached . The radionuclide may be linked to the non -radioactive ligand 82  by a linker and/or chelators also called âcarrierâ. In the following , all possible forms of the non - 83  radioactive moiety will be named ânon -radioactive partâ throughout the paper.  84   Guideline on the non -clinical requirements for   radiopharmaceuticals    EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018  Page 4/10   General guidance, especially for the timing and duration of nonclinical safety studies, can be received 85  from ICH M3(R2)  EMA/CPMP/ICH/286/1995.  However, in many cases knowledge of the non -clinical 86  characteristics and a clinical experience already exists for the non -radioactive part. In common with any 87  other submission the presence of published or clinical data may obviate the need to conduct the 88  complete non-clinical program me in line with ICH M3(R2) . This would also contribute to a reduction of 89  animal use in line with the principles of 3Rs. Factors that are important to consider are  the level of 90  evidence on the pharmacological properties and toxicological characteristics of the non- radioactive  part, 91  the anticipated mass dose of the radiopharmaceutical in the clinical trial or for marketing authorisation 92  and the duration of treatment.   93  The need for physiological distribution studies for the sole purpose of ensuring quality of the 94  investigational radiopharmaceutical  should be avoided by any means. Instead, appropriate 95  characterisation of the relevant product parameters is expected by stat e-of-the art methods.  96  4.  Legal basis  97  This guideline has to be read in conjunction with:  98  â¢ Directives of the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) (Directive 2013/59/Euratom).  99  â¢ Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended in particular Directive 2001/83/EC Art 10(4) and Part II of the 100  Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended.  101  â¢ Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.  102  â¢ Directive 2004/10/EC on the harmonisation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions 103  relating to the appli cation of the principles of good laboratory practice and the verification of their 104  applications for tests on chemical substances.  105  â¢ CHMP/SWP/28367/07 (July 2017): "Guideline on strategies to identify and mitigate risks for first in 106  human and early clinical t rials with investigational medicinal products".  107  â¢ EMEA/CHMP/QWP/306970/2007:"Guideline on Radiopharmaceuticals" . 108  â¢ ICH S6(R1) (December 2011):"Preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology âderived 109  pharmaceuticals".  110  â¢ ICH S9 (Oct 29, 2009):"Nonclinical evaluatio n for anticancer pharmaceuticals".  111  â¢ ICH M3(R2) (Dec. 2009):"Non -clinical safety studies for the conduct of human clinical trials and 112  marketing authorisation for pharmaceuticals".  113  â¢ ICH S7A (June 2001): âNote for guidance on safety pharmacology studies for hum an 114  pharmaceuticalsâ . 115  5.  "Targeted" non -clinical evaluation of radiopharmaceuticals  116  5.1.  Basic considerations  117  Toxicity of radiopharmaceuticals may be driven by the non -radioactive as well as the radioactive 118  components of the radiopharmaceutical. T he radiation emitted by the radionuclide is a wanted property 119  of radiotherapeutics . In the case of radiodiagnostics , however, radionuclides with much lower emission 120  of radiation and with usually  a very short physical half -life are used . 121   Guideline on the non -clinical requirements for   radiopharmaceuticals    EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018  Page 5/10   For characterisation of a new radiopharmaceutical , a biodistribution study  in animals is  usually 122  conducted  with the radiolabelled compound  allowing to measure tissue distribution and elimination . In 123  addition , calculation of dosimetry in order to predict the radioactive exposure in humans  and to mitigate 124  radiation induced toxicity , is performed.  However,  as mentioned in the scope,  recommendations for the 125  non-clinical development  of the non- radioactive part  are the focus of this guideline . 126  For different  scenarios as outlined below, where evidence needs to be only partly generated, a targeted 127  (in the sense of a reduced) non -clinical program me for the non- radioactive part of the 128  radiopharmaceutical can be considered:  129  a) Radionuclide changed in  a known radiopharmaceutical : only the radionu clide is changed and the 130  non-radioactive part was already used in numerous clinical trials or even authoris ed with other 131  radionuclides. In this case, evidence should be provided by the applicant on the availability and 132  results of the non -clinical testing a lready performed for the non -radioactive unchanged part  of the 133  formerly used radiopharmaceutical(s). Reference in the dossier to previous applications with the 134  investigational radiopharmaceutical may be possible in cases the applicant is the same or has 135  obtained permission to use non -clinical data of other applications. The use of literature or other 136  publicly available data is possible but should be of good scientific  quality  and justified by the 137  applicant.  138  In these cases a flexible, but targeted approach i s required to identify possible remaining gaps in 139  the safety information for the new investigational radiopharmaceutical especially with focus on 140  pharmacology.   141  b) Radionuclide added to a known non- radioactive pharmaceutical: i nformation is needed that the 142  radiolabelling does not significantly alter the pharmacology of the whole molecule when the 143  radionuclide is replacing an existing non -radioactive atom.  144  c) Minimal change of the non -radioactive part of a radiopharmaceutical: t his could be a small change in 145  the amino acid sequence of a peptide or another small change in the molecular structure of the non - 146  radioactive part  of a known radiopharmaceutical, intended for example  to improve stability . For this 147  new but structurally  closely related entity , the applicant  should bridge from existing non -clinical data 148  of the known radiopharmaceutical and address possible changes in  its pharmacolog y and safety in 149  order to allow for a  possibl e reduced non-clinical program me. 150  The microdose approach described in ICH M3(R2)  is reflecting single as well as multiple administrations 151  up to five including a wash out period and implies a reduced non -clinical testing in which safety 152  assessment in a single (rodent) species can suffice.  153  Due to possible peculiarities as outlined above a reduced non -clinical testing could be anticipated for 154  additional scenarios. For example at dosages outside microdose  toxicities related to the non -radioactive 155  part are usually still minor compared to radiat ion-induced toxicities of a radio therapeutic in oncology 156  treatment . The amount of non- clinical data needed for the non -radioactive part is therefore dependent 157  on risk âbenefit considerations and exposure levels to the non -radioactive part. Hence, also in th ese 158  cases a study in one species could be considered to be sufficient.  159  The aspects outlined above give rise to specific considerations regarding the extent and type of the non - 160  clinical data package to support clinical trial and marketing authorisation of r adiopharmaceuticals. 161  Specific approaches will avoid the unnecessary use of animals, allowing an optimal use of resources and, 162  ultimately, facilitate the progression of these medicinal products into clinical use.  In this regard , such a 163  targeted non -clinical program me represent s an opportunity for limiting animal testing  in accordance 164  with the 3Rs principles and  is strongly encouraged.  165   Guideline on the non -clinical requirements for   radiopharmaceuticals    EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018  Page 6/10   However, the spectrum of possible combinations of molecules to construct a radiopharmaceutical i n 166  addition to the possible therapeutic targets of radiopharmaceuticals is very broad. Therefore, a flexible 167  approach on a case by case  basis might still be needed despite this guideline.  168  5.2.  Non-clinical safety program me for a known or minimally  changed non- 169  radioactive part of a new radiopharmaceutical 170  In case no  reference is possible to previous applications or other public data using the identical non- 171  radioactive part of the investigational radiopharmaceutical, the reduced non -clinical program me outlined 172  below for a known or minimally changed non -radioactive part should be considered.  173  5.2.1.  Pharmacology  174  The appropriate characteri sation of pharmacology of the non -radioactive part alone is also expected in 175  the case where the non- radioactive part of an alr eady known radiopharmaceutical is claimed to be 176  minimally changed. Emphasis should be laid on in vitro target/ receptor profiling.  The selectivity and 177  specificity of the non -radioactive part as well as secondary pharmacodynamics, defined as effects on 178  other than the desired therapeutic targets, should be critically evaluated and documented. M easureable 179  pharmacodynamic effects are normally not expected to be seen from the non -radioactive part of most 180  radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic or therapeutic purpose s. However, evidence for the absence of 181  pharmacodynamic effects is expected, and should be supported by appropriate data. 182  If no data are provided,  the applicant has to justify the absence of in vitro/in vivo pharmacology data 183  even in the case of a minimal change to the molecule.  184  5.2.2.  Pharmacokinetic s 185  For such minimally changed radiopharmaceutical s information on in vivo stability should be available. In 186  addition,  the biodistribution study  performed in healthy animals of a relevant species  including  187  dosimetry should be thoroughly evaluated to detect any change in biodistribution and target organs 188  related to the non -radioactive part compared to the former, known molecule.  For radiotherapeutics, the 189  study may be performed in an animal model of disease,  if appropriate, to support that the targeted area  190  / organ will still be reached adequately.  191  5.2.3.  Toxicology  192  Main focus should be laid on the evaluation of the target organs of biodistribution and possible 193  persistence of the modified non-radioactive part  possib ly leading to so far unknown toxic effects even if 194  the change is claimed to be minimal . A biodistribution study in one species with s ingle application and 195  integrated measurement of toxicity endpoints can be generally considered sufficient . If off target bi nding 196  is likely to be minimal from the results of the dosimetry s tudy, histopathological examination may be 197  limited to target organs.  198  In the case of an e xploratory trial with intended clinical dose of the radiopharmaceutical being a 199  microdose according to approach 1 or approach 2 as outlined in ICH M3 (R2) (see also 5.3) and if, in 200  addition , the absence of pharmacological activity of the non -radioactive part could be demonstrated,  201  such a biodistribution study could be waived.  202   Guideline on the non -clinical requirements for   radiopharmaceuticals    EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018  Page 7/10   5.3.  Non-clinical safety program me of a new radiopharmaceutical using 203  microdose  204  The majority of clinical trials performed with radiopharmaceuticals falls under the scope of exploratory 205  trials. Therefore, the microdose approach as outlined in ICH M3 (R2) can be applied. According to the 206  definition given there , a microdose is a total dose â¤ 100 Âµg (no inter -dose interval limitations) and total 207  dose â¤ 1/100th  NOAEL and â¤1/100th  pharmacologically active dose (approach 1), or a t otal cumulative 208  dose â¤ 500 Î¼g, maximum of 5 administrations with a washout between doses (6 or more actual or 209  predicted half -lives) and each dose â¤ 100 Î¼g and each dose â¤ 1/100th of the NOAEL and â¤ 1/100th of 210  the pharmacologically active dose (approach 2). Due  to differences in molecular weights between 211  biologicals and che micals, and  due to  the fact that pharmacological and toxicological effects are usually 212  driven by the molar amount and not by the mass, a maximum dose above 100 Âµ g based on molar 213  amount can be accepted for high molecular weight molecules taking into account  the potency of the 214  molecule (approach 1 for biologicals). Approach 2 may be less relevant for biologicals with a long 215  elimination half -life. 216  Accordingly, the minimal requirements for the non -clinical development of a radiopharmaceutical 217  carrying a new non-radioactive part using the microdose approach are outlined below.  This non- clinical 218  package is usually also considered sufficient for marketing authorisation applications  using the same 219  dosing regimen .  220  5.3.1.  Recommendations for Radiodiagnostics  221  In most case s microdose approach 1 of ICH M3(R2) will be used for radiodiagnostics since no 222  pharmacological effect is intende d and only a very small mass dose is administered after single 223  administration . 224  5.3.1.1.  Pharmacology  225  Radiodiagnostics are not intended to exert pharmacological activity, but evidence for  the absence of 226  pharmacological activity of the non -radioactive part  should be provided. In this context, in vitro target/ 227  receptor profiling is usually sufficient . 228  5.3.1.2.  Pharmacokinetic s 229  A biodistribution study including dosime try should be performed with  a single dose of  the 230  radiodiagnostic. Information on in vivo stability, distribution and elimination should be available to allow 231  estimation of tissue and whole -body radiation doses in the clinic  and to identify target organs for 232  distribution and persistence of the radiodiagnostic.  If relevant, information shou ld be provided on 233  absorption and biotransformation.  234  5.3.1.3.  Toxicology  235  According to microdose approach 1 outlined in ICH M3(R2), the results of an extended single dose 236  toxicity study using the intended route of administration (usually i.v. route for radiodiagnostics) , with 237  toxicokinetic data  should be available for the non- radioactive part . 238  When using the microdose approach 2, a repeat dose study for  at least 7 days would be expected. A 239  study of shorter duration may be considered on a case by case basis.  240  For both approaches a study in one species , usually rodent,  can be generally considered sufficient.  241   Guideline on the non -clinical requirements for   radiopharmaceuticals    EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018  Page 8/10   In the extended single dose, as well as in repeat dose studies, haematology, clinical chemistry, necropsy 242  data and histopathology will be fully evaluated.  243  Investigation of local tolerance, where applicable, should be done as an integral part of the extended 244  single dose study.  245  5.3.1.4.  Genotoxicity  246  Genotoxicity studies  are not recommended. However, if e.g. data on structure -activity relationship 247  (SAR) assessment are available they should be submitted.  248  5.3.2.  Recommendations for Radiotherapeutics  249  The same testing strategy as outlined above for radiodiagnostics will also apply for new 250  radiotherapeutics when using the microdose approach. The only additional aspect to consider in these 251  cases is that the dosimetry study might be performed in an animal model of disease, if appropriate, to 252  support that the targeted area will be reached adequately.  253  5.4.  Non-clinical safety program me of a new radiopharmaceutical using 254  single sub -pharmacological or pharmacologically active doses  255  The minimal requirements for the n on-clinical development of a radiopharmaceutical carrying a  new 256  non-radioactive part using  single sub -pharmacological (but above microdos e) or pharmacologically 257  active doses are outlined below. This non -clinical package is usually also considered sufficien t for 258  marketing authorisation applications  using the same dosing regimen .  259  5.4.1.  Recommendations for Radiodiagnostics  260  5.4.1.1.  Pharmacology  261  Radiodiagnostics may exert pharmacological activity  at doses above a microdose. The pharmacological 262  activity of the non -radioactive  part or its absence has to be shown by the applicant. In this context, in 263  vitro target/ receptor profiling is usually sufficient.  264  5.4.1.2.  Pharmacokinetic s 265  A biodistribution study including dosimetry should be performed with a single dose of the 266  radiodiagnostic. I nformation on in vivo stability, distribution and elimination should be available to allow 267  estimation of tissue and whole -body radiation doses in the clinic and to identify target organs for 268  distribution and persistence of the radiodiagnostic. If relevant,  information should be provided on 269  absorption and biotransformation.  270  5.4.1.3.  Toxicology  271  Generally, extended single dose toxicity studies in both a rodent and non -rodent should be available 272  using the intended clinical route of administration with toxicokinetics, haematology, clinical chemistry, 273  necropsy data and histopathology as evaluated endpoints . 274  If the non- radioactive part of the radiopharmaceutical does not show pharmacological activity at the 275  intended clinical dose only one relevant species, usually rodent,  is sufficient.  276  Investigation of local tolerance, where applicable, should be done as integral part of the extended single 277  dose study.  278   Guideline on the non -clinical requirements for   radiopharmaceuticals    EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018  Page 9/10   In addition, the standard core battery for safety pharmacology may be included as integral part of the 279  extended single do se toxicity study.  280  5.4.1.4.  Genotoxicity  281  For the genotoxicity testing of the non- radioactive part  of the radiodiagnostic , if not a biotechnology 282  derived product,  e.g. an Ames test, would be expected.  283  5.4.2.  Recommendations for Radiotherapeutics  284  The same testing strategy as outlined above for radiodiagnostics will apply for new radiotherapeutics in 285  the case using single sub -pharmacological or pharmacologically active doses are used.  The only 286  additional aspect to consider in these cases is that the dosimetry study might be performed in an animal 287  model of disease, if appropriate, to support that the targeted area will be reached adequately.  288  5.5.  Non-clinical safety program me for radiopharmaceuticals using  multiple  289  dosing  290  In absence of complete clearance between administration of multiple doses in the therapeutic range 291  standard ICH M3(R2) requirements should be followed for the non -radioactive part . There are no 292  general differences in this respect between the expected non -clinical data package for radiodiagnostics 293  and radiotherapeu tics. In the case of a radiotherapeutic used in oncology , ICH S9 should be considered 294  if applicable . 295  5.5.1.  Pharmacology  296  Pharmacological activity of the non -radioactive part or its absence has to be shown by the applicant. In 297  this context, in vitro target/ receptor profiling is usually sufficient.  298  5.5.2.  Pharmacokinetic s 299  A biodistribution study including dosimetry after administration of the whole radiodiagnostic should be 300  performed. Information on in vivo stability, distribution and elimination should be available to allow 301  estimation of tissue and whole -body radiation doses in the clinic and to identify target organs for 302  distribution and persistence of the radiodiagnostic.  303  5.5.3.  Toxicology  304  In the case of complete washout between dosing an exte nded single dose toxicity study  in both a rodent 305  and non- rodent should be available using the intended clinical route of administration with 306  toxicokinetics, haematology, clinical chemistry, necropsy data and histop athology as evaluated 307  endpoints. If the non- radioactive part of the radiopharmaceutical does not show pharmacological activity 308  at the intended clinical dose only one relevant species, usually rodent,  is sufficient.  309  Investigation of local tolerance, where a pplicable, should be done as an integral part of the extended 310  single dose study.  311  In addition, the standard core battery for safety pharmacology may be included as integral part of the 312  extended single dose toxicity study.  313   Guideline on the non -clinical requirements for   radiopharmaceuticals    EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018  Page 10/10   5.5.4.  Genotoxicity  314  For the genotoxicity testing of the non- radioactive  part of the radiotherapeutic , if not a biotechnology 315  derived product,  e.g. an Ames test would be expected. In the case of a radiotherapeutic used in 316  oncology, an Ames assay may not be required for advanced cancers where ICH  S9 is applicable.  317  5.5.5.  Repro ductive toxicity and Carcinogenicity  318  For radio pharmaceuticals carrying a radionuclide  with a high emi ssion of radiation and a long half -life 319  such as anticancer drugs,  carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity studies could be waived since the 320  radiation emission of these medicinal products is causing well known DNA damage with consequences 321  for carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity. However, the respective risk should be outlined in the 322  product labelling.  323  Reproductive toxicity and a carcinogenicity stud ies for the non -radioactive part alone are usually not 324  required unless there is concern due to the duration of the treatment while  the radiation emission of the 325  attached radionuclide  is low . 326  6.  GLP 327  It is generally expected that non -clinical  safety studies are carried out in conformity with the principles 328  of GLP (Dir 2004/10/EC), but also principles of animal welfare  should be applied. However, it is 329  recognized that, due to the specific characteristics of radiopharmaceuticals, it might not be  possible to 330  conduct every study  in conformity with GLP , in particular when  the radiation emission is high . 331  Frequently , such non-GLP results come from biodistribution and dosimetry studies.  Therefore, in 332  practice the relevant safety aspects are usually sufficiently addressed by conducting the non -clinical 333  studies with the non -radioactive part of the radiopharmaceutical  according to GLP . 334  If a pivotal non -clinical safety study has not been conducted in conformity with the GLP principles, a 335  scientific  justification should be submitted. This justification should also address the potential impact of 336  the non- compliance on the reliability of the safety data.  In any case the  study should run according to 337  the principles of GLP as close as possible . Detailed documentation of the study conduct, results and 338  archiving of data should be ensured. In addition, the study should be performed in accordance with a 339  prospectively designed study protocol . 340  7.

The requirements are not the same between them; therefore, for someone who needs to register a product through EMA and US FDA, it is necessary to know about the prerequisites. The objective of this article is to summarize the EMA and US FDA non-clinical requirements for the registration of radiodiagnostic agents, along with comparing and comprehending the similarities and differences between them. EMA versus US FDA, non-clinical requirements for radiodiagnostics [1,2] The non-clinical requirements for registration of radiodiagnostic agents in EMA and US FDA are illustrated in Table 1. The non-clinical phase is one of the important aspects of drug development; hence, extensive testing is required before the first human exposure. Specific to radiodiagnostics, the non-clinical development requirements are relatively lesser as compared to the non-clinical development of a drug; however, the type of non-clinical studies to be conducted should be determined on a case-by-case basis. For instance, the US FDA has discovered delayed radiation effects of radiodiagnostics as a serious risk, and such issues can be addressed through dosimetry and radiation threshold studies in animals before first human exposure. Because of the small dose (microdose), infrequent exposure (unless it is warranted), and low potential for toxicity compared to pharmaceuticals and radiotherapeutics. In these lines, when an inventor is looking to launch an already existing radiodiagnostic product in a different geographical region (For example, for launching a USFDA-approved radiodiagnostic agent in EMA region or vice versa), based on the regulatory requirements, gap analysis needs to be performed to ascertain further steps on the submissions. Knowing the regulatory requirements (EMA and USFDA) will help us develop the checklist for the dossier preparation. At Clinchoice, we have a dedicated team of experts who look after the different aspects of radio diagnostic submissions for approval, which includes summarizing the regulatory requirements, performing gap analysis, developing checklists and regulatory strategies, preparing of dossier, among other services.

The MUNC18-1 protein is a key protein that helps organize the SNARE-complex which is responsible for mediating vesicle fusion with the cell membrane or other vesicles 2 . A mutation in the STXBP1 gene can result in impairment of psychomotor and neurodevelopmental capabilities 1 . Phenotypically, individuals with STXBP1 gene mutation and disruption of SNARE-complex formation of MUNC-18-1 protein will present with intellectual disability, movement disorders, and epilepsy 3 . Severe early onset epileptic encephalopathies, such as Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, and Dravet syndrome are associated with mutations in the MUNC18-1/STXBP1 5 . These encephalopathies are often fatal and are categorized by severe intellectual disability and cerebral dysfunction. Most encephalopathies include incessant epileptic activity that causes decline in cognitive, sensory and/or motor function 5 . STXBP1-related disorders are rare, only 750 cases of individuals diagnosed with an STXBP1 disorder are known worldwide 4 . The incidence of STXBP1 disorder ranges between 3.3-3.8 per 100,000 births and impacts families from various ethnic backgrounds that spans North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia 4 . STXBP1 Summit 2022 ClinChoice had the pleasure of being a Champion Sponsor at the STXBP1 Summit that took place in August of this year. The STXBP1 Summit was an opportunity to learn firsthand from family members who are caregivers of this delicate patient population. The conference offered a bridge between all key stakeholders that are involved in research surrounding STXBP1. The event also provided a unique environment to connect with patients, investigators, researchers, sponsors, and families. The silos that are often found in research were non-existent and everyone was able to freely communicate. This occasion fostered a wealth of information and perspectives to be shared amongst each key stakeholder. At ClinChoice, the experiences as a collective in the research realm have broadened our understanding of research at all levels. Areas of profound recognition include the importance of involvement from rare disease foundations, listening to parents and advocates on how to lessen the burden of participating in a clinical trial, as well as ways to improve trust and increase patient participation and retention. Having these events is important for intrapersonal and interpersonal development and cultivates a community of trust between all key stakeholders participating in research. Current studies and research in STXBP1 STXBP1 studies are still in the early stages of development. Currently there are no approved cures for this disorder. The available therapeutic strategies are centered around treating the symptoms of the disorder, mainly epilepsy 5 . While some children with STXBP1-disorder seizure episodes dissipates approximately 40% of children still have epileptic episodes 6 . The only FDA approved drug that is being used to determine its effects on STXBP1 disorder symptoms is known as Glycerol phenylbutyrate 7 . This drug is used to lower high levels of ammonia in the blood caused by urea cycle disorders 7 . Although glycerol phenylbutyrate is an FDA approved drug it is not approved for STXBP1 disorder indication. Nonetheless studies have shown some reverse to the deficits caused by mutations in the MUNC18-1/STXBP1 in mice models 7 . There are currently clinical trials testing glycerol phenylbutyrate in children to ascertain whether they can observe the same or similar improvements in deficits caused by STXBP1 mutation 8 . In addition to this drug study there are other studies coming in the pipeline which were highlighted at the SXTBP1 Summit such as natural history studies, further exploration in mice models, zebrafish models, and gene therapy research. Researchers, sponsors, and investigators are taking various approaches to furthering the science of STXBP1 that can potentially result in more treatment options and lead to a cure for this disease. Conclusion STXBP1 is a rare disease that phenotypically can present like many neurodevelopmental disorders. The treatments available are more focused on alleviating the symptoms of the disease and are highly centered around seizures. Doctors, sponsors, and researchers from around the world are working diligently to find out more about the STXBP1 disorder. The STXBP1 Summit acts as a vehicle where all stakeholders can share ideas, foster relationships, and cultivate a community of strength, knowledge, and compassion. At ClinChoice, we are working together with these stakeholders to advance science to improve the quality of life of the individuals and families impacted by STXBP1 disorder.

RA mainly affects the joints, usually more than one joint simultaneously. As a shock absorber for joints, RA damages the cartilage by uncontrolled inflammation. The result is deformed joints over time. Finally, the bone itself starts to erode. In the aftermath of tissue damage, patients may experience long-term pain, instability, and misalignment of their bodies. Hands, wrists, and knees are commonly affected by this disease. The condition can affect other parts of the body, such as the heart, lungs, skin, and eyes. 1 As of 2021, it was estimated that 350 million people in the world have arthritis (according to the Global RA network ). Since the disease is so endemic, prevention or treatment is incredibly important, and many drugs have been developed to reduce swelling and pain. However, finding a cure for this disorder has been challenging unless the exact cause is determined and unfortunately, clinical trials for drugs designed to address RA are characterized by many challenges. Rheumatoid Arthritis Drugs: challenges in clinical trials Several treatment options for RA can lead to different clinical outcomes. Treatment failure may be correlated with established negative predictive or predisposing factors such as genetic factors, comorbidities, extra-articular symptoms (cardiovascular disease), or pregnancy, among others. These factors plague clinical trials and that present many challenges. Every stage of clinical development must have the safety of patients as the primary focus, even if it isnât the primary end goal. Hence, choosing the correct sample size, dosage, effectiveness, and other aspects are necessary before starting a clinical trial. Statistical challenges, for the most part, emerge at this point. Having reliable comparators, cautiously selecting study participants, and tracking long-term safety are all important aspects of testing new RA drugs effectively 2 . Every situation must be considered during the trial phases of RA. For example, it may coexist with other conditions or lead to several diseases such as cardiovascular disease. When considering the above example, RA also imposes a broader challenge due to the patient group, making sample size a significant concern. Consequently, there may be dropouts or missing information. Thus, biostatisticians face various challenges during the formulation of the model. The dry run phase could be problematic if the correct data is not entered. Because of this, biostatisticians usually devise alternative strategies. We will take a closer look at the major challenges in developing RA drugs and find out how the biostatisticians are tackling them. Challenge vs. Solution Challenge 1: Multiplicity Issues during the clinical trial An overwhelming amount of trial reports usually do not address multiple testing effectively. Multiplicity involves increasing the type I error rate due to various comparisons, such as comparing subgroups, comparing treatment arms, analyzing multiple results, and analyzing the same results for different intervals of time. Clinical trials have multiple testing problems, which can increase the risk of type I and type II errors, resulting in unexpected interpretation of results. Multiplicity issues should be considered for the initial design, analysis, and interpretation. In RA, multiplicity can occur if the primary endpoint is assessed in more than one way or during interim analyses. It is due to the association of the disorder with several predisposing factors. Consider a group of patients with RA, for example, that have diverse comorbidities; the new drug may have different effects on each patient, resulting in various outcomes 3 . A multiplicity problem arises when multiple hypotheses are tested. It is increasingly likely that at least one valid null hypothesis will be rejected with each new test. When multiplicity is not considered, the chances of at least one null hypothesis being wrongly rejected increase. Multiplicity is one of the reasons regulators are interested in seeing a control plan. Solution: Adjusting Multiplicity A lot of adjustments must be made by expert biostatisticians to resolve multiplicity issues. Here are some approaches to resolve or adjust this matter of concern. Multiple primary endpoints may be considered co-primary endpoints. Co-primary endpoints can be various monitoring measures targeted at different aspects of a disease, strengthening the evidence for treatment effectiveness. As a result, the trial will only be successful if all primary endpoints are tested successfully (every null hypothesis is rejected). Hochberg adjustments with ânâ hypotheses is another approach. It requires that the worst performing hypothesis pass. Obtaining success for one test will achieve success for all the others that havenât been evaluated yet. A more challenging threshold would be applied to the next badly performing hypothesis when a test fails. Itâs important to adjust the threshold because it helps to prevent false rejections due to small p-values (less than 5%) occurring by chance 4 . Like the test outlined above, a Holm adjustment approach aims to make passing the most highly performing test challenging. It is followed by a gradual easing of the level of difficulty. One test that fails indicates that all subsequent tests that are not yet assessed have failed as well. Bonferroni correction: This test is specifically designed to evaluate multiple comparators. The main objective is to decrease the error rate in each comparison since it may impact the other results, causing multiple false positives. Bonferroniâs adjustment involves dividing the number of tests by the alpha value (Type-I error) 4 . Among these, we recommend the fixed sequence testing (Using a pre-specified sequence of hypotheses) and the Bonferroni correction model, in which the P value is well-adjusted, as one of the most effective approaches to resolve multiplicity problems. But now that we have tackled the multiplicity issue, we are faced with a major concern: missing information/data. In trials, a large amount of data is collected (especially considering various factors), and it is possible to be lost or missed. How can this be prevented? Challenge 2: Missing Information/data It is common practice to monitor and evaluate a lot of data in RA trials, whether in patient records or published literature. There is always the risk of missing data in clinical research. Nevertheless, they have the potential to diminish the validity of the results. Until recently, statistical methods for dealing with missing data werenât widely available. When missing data is present, the analysis is usually limited to only complete cases â those with no missing data in any of the variables included in the analysis. These analyses often produce biased results. Moreover, missing data associated with multiple variables often results in a large percentage of the original sample being excluded. It, in turn, reduces the sensitivity and specificity of the analysis. The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E9 guidelines state that missing data should be prevented at any cost. It is acknowledged that there is no one solution for rectifying missing data because every design and measurement is different. A sensitivity analysis is suggested, and missing data handling will be defined in the protocol, as well as reasons for revocation. Data can be missing randomly (completely or not) or not random at all. As far as new approaches are concerned, several can be implemented statistically. Solution: Handling Missing Data In order to handle missing data, several approaches are available. Here are some examples 5 : Last observation carried forward (LOCF): After those who have opted out of follow-up investigations, LOCF carries forward their last observation to their last time point. If this approach is used, the carried-forward values can be treated as the observed values for the rest of the observation period. Baseline observation carried forward: It is generally used in trials where the endpoint will return to its baseline value after withdrawal, such as chronic pain in RA trials. Mixed models repeated measures (MMRM): MMRM is preferred for longitudinal continuous outcomes in individually randomized trials. In addition to avoiding model ambiguity, this model is unbiased for missing data absent at random or completely absent at random 6 . Multiple Imputation (MI): Managing missing data using MI is a well-used approach. MI entails calculating multiple probable values and filling in the missing data for each subject with missing data related to a given variable. In turn, multiple completed sets of data are created. It enables the user to properly account for the ambiguity about the true value of imputed variables. Binary variables are imputed using logistic regression models, and continuous variables are imputed using linear regression models 7 . When missing data is present, these are typically the approaches used. As a best practice, we recommend multiple imputations in such cases of missing data. Depending on the kind of data that is missing and the level of complexity of the problem, the model can be tailored to meet the needs of the project. Challenge 3: High Failure Rate/Failing to meet expectations Innovation in RA pharmaceuticals is becoming increasingly challenging and expensive. The recruitment target and timeline of clinical trials often do not adhere to expectations. Time, workforce, funding, and patient pool resources are vital in randomized controlled trials. Despite the availability of these resources, it is important to remember that they are not always plentiful. The price of successfully bringing a breakthrough drug to market is high due to late-stage drug failures and the rising costs of confirmatory or follow-up trials. In traditional clinical trials, predefined elements are used to design the study. Several shortcomings of randomized clinical trials have been noted in addressing factors and variables with rigid models. These trialsâ success depends on the quality of their clinical assessments. Unfortunately, they are often inaccurate due to numerous anomalies, multiple endpoints, and missing data. As a result of excessive patient dropouts during the clinical stage, profound changes in design are necessary and mostly unavoidable 8 . Solution: Adaptive Design It is a method of modifying an ongoing trialâs design or statistical procedures during its testing phase in response to variables generated by the trial in question, thus improving the trialâs flexibility. The goal of adaptive clinical trial designs is to make trials more efficient by shortening durations, reducing participant numbers, adjustment/modification of statistical hypotheses, and increasing the likelihood that the drug benefits the trial participants. Also, they effectively address issues related to trial design, for instance, patient variability and relevant treatment effects. Predetermined changes that adaptive designs may permit statistically include: Optimizing the sample size Abstinence from various treatments or doses Allocating patients to trial arms in a different sequence Selecting patients with the highest likelihood of benefiting from recruitment programs Terminating a trial early because of failure or lack of effectiveness Early conclusions are possible to facilitate the development of new, effective drugs To some extent, the FDA and EMEA have demonstrated leadership in implementing adaptive trial design 9 . Itâs imperative to follow the guidelines of the FDA/EMEA while implementing an adaptive design Conclusion Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects millions of people every year. RA can be effectively treated and managed by following a comprehensive dose regimen and self-management practices. The diseaseâs complexity presents several challenges in planning a clinical trial. A successful trial requires understanding the perspectives of all stakeholders. Consequently, overcoming these issues is imperative during a trialâs dry run. Hence, the best simulation models are used to achieve optimal results.

It must be sufficiently comparable to the latter to determine whether a generic drug is therapeutically equivalent to an innovator product. To be market-effective, drug companies must develop generic drugs that achieve the same level of therapeutic safety, efficacy, and functionality as branded drugs 1 . The Canadian Health Authority (Health Canada ) seeks to increase the availability of generic drugs to make them more affordable, safe, and accessible. Currently, generic drugs receive approvals 15 to 20 times more often than new drugs. Health Canadaâs Health Products and Food Branch (HPFB) regulates, evaluates, and monitors the safety, efficacy, and quality therapeutic and diagnostic products available to the public. Several guidelines explain to what extent data must be provided before Health Canada approves a drug. As a result, for a generic drug to be approved and introduced on the market, a submission must be made to the HPFB. Upon a positive review by the HPFB, the generic drug is granted a Notice of Compliance (NOC) and a Drug Identification Number (DIN). A crucial component of regulatory approval of the generic drug is the Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS) process 2 . Abbreviated New Drugs Submission: The Pathway to Generic Drug Approval A sponsor must submit an ANDS if a generic version of a previously approved drug is deemed âpharmacologically equivalentâ or âbioequivalentâ to the Canadian Reference Product (CRP). The following criteria must be met in accordance with the FDA Regulations (FDR) to file an ANDS: The generic drug is bioequivalent or pharmaceutically equivalent to the Canadian Reference Product (CRP) The generic drug has the same medicinal ingredients, in the same amount, with the same dosage form as the CRP The generic drug is administered by the same route as that of CRP 2 There may be differences in non-medicinal ingredients (excipients) between generic drugs and CRPs. However, the company must demonstrate that these differences do not affect the generic drugâs safety, efficacy, or quality. Although these are the main points to remember, there are also many other aspects to consider for the successful approval of an ANDS. Generic Drug Submission in Canada: Common Pitfalls to Avoid A generic drug submission, or ANDS, goes through the same review process as a brand-name drug submission. The following points should be considered when filling out the ANDS to avoid common mistakes. Suitable studies should be conducted to design and test a generic drug. A generic drug must meet all national and international patent and data protection requirements. ANDS cannot be submitted before a patent expires or a manufacturer challenges it 2 . The generic drug must comply with current laws and regulations and follow the recommendations laid out in Health Canadaâs guidance documents 3 . Certified Product Information Document â Chemical Entities (CPID-CE) must accompany the original submission of an ANDS, which will help the Review Division reserve, plan, and allocate the necessary resources 3 . A bioequivalence study between the generic drug and CRP must be conducted per Health Canadaâs recommendations. Foreign sourced reference products could be used instead of CRP if the following conditions are met 4 . The foreign-sourced reference product is approved by a comparable regulatory authority (US, EU, Japan, Australia, Switzerland). The same innovator company markets foreign-sourced reference products. Comparative in vitro studies between CRP and foreign-sourced reference products are submitted. Other conditions laid down in the Health Canada guidance document are met 4 . If the generic drug is intended to be imported into Canada, then the importer in Canada should be identified well in advance. The establishment license of the importer in Canada must list the foreign manufacturing sites of drug substance and drug product. Non-medicinal ingredients, shape, size, and color of a generic drug, can differ from CRP as long as it is bioequivalent to the CRP. All generic drugs must adhere to regulatory guidelines for good manufacturing practices in their manufacturing processes and facilities. Each drug batch must also undergo both pre-and post-production tests to meet its intended use 5 . Conclusion Generic drugs have a large market potential in Canada, and it is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. Multinational pharmaceutical companies and small companies can expand their generic drug portfolios in the Canadian generic drug market. Marketing authorizations denied by the HPFB can be supplemented, resubmitted with new information, or have the decision reviewed. Several best practices are recommended for ANDS that will aid the approval of generic drugs: To ensure that the technical information meets the requirements of Health Canada, a gap analysis should be performed. Attestation checklists are an important part of the ANDS screening process to help sponsors ensure that their submissions are complete and include all of the necessary information. The quality part of the ANDS must comply with Health Canadaâs recommendations. Compliance with guidance documents on recent topics e.g., nitrosamine impurities, and elemental impurities should be ensured 3 . Before submitting an ANDS application, all manufacturing facilities should be ready for inspection. The original ANDS must include a detailed justification, including supporting data, of why they use an alternative bioequivalence method to those recommended in the relevant product-specific guidance. For maximum success, ANDS submission strategies and guidance on risk mitigation plans should be tailored as per Health Canada requirements 6 .

For the first time in over 2 years, colleagues, partners, and friends gathered at the Drug Information Association conference in person. And then, seemingly in the blink of an eye, the conference was over! Here are some key takeaways from ClinChoice: Technology: Clinical technology continues to evolve and improve at an exponential pace. Featuring a wide range of solutions including EDC, ePro/eCOA, eConsent, enrollment trackers and televisits, eTMF, CTMS, data automation, data visualization and more, technology was one of the hottest topics at DIA 2022. Emerging tech in virtual reality and blockchain was also being discussed. This yearâs show featured a virtual reality demonstration that was simply stunning. ClinChoice caught up with several of our valued technology partners including Medidata, Veeva, Calyx, Cloudbyz and SAS. Decentralized trials: One of the buzzwords of the clinical development world in 2022, conversations and speaker sessions surrounding the topic of decentralized clinical trials were featured early and often. While we noticed some healthy debate over the risk of the DCT format, one thing is certain: this topic is not going away. Companies will continue to invest in improving and optimizing the decentralized clinical trial model, with the goal of providing added accessibility to patients without compromising safety and efficacy. Leveraging partnerships: CROs, Sponsors, and clinical technology companies continue to realize the value of partnering with one another to achieve the common goal of offering the highest quality clinical solutions possible. Every company has different core competencies, so it only makes sense to leverage our strengths for the overall benefit of faster, more efficient, and higher quality drug development. This bodes well with this yearâs DIA conference theme of âInnovation through Collaboration!â We are all in this together. Final thoughts: Having the chance to come together and collaborate in person offered a sense of optimism that has rarely been felt since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Smiles were abundant throughout the conference, and the overall mood was extremely friendly and cheerful. The pandemic created one of the most challenging times in recent human history.

As technologies improve and advanced capabilities become accessible, new tools, methodologies, and processes also emerge. Depending on the area of research, size, target demographics, and other factors, these new technologies can help improve efficiency, accuracy, speed, and the quality of data gathered and analyzed. A key element of any CROâs overall strategy should be to explore the leading edge of whatâs possible in clinical research. Todayâs tech-driven solutions help monitor and leverage real-world evidence (RWE) and real-world data (RWD) to provide the clearest and most accurate courses to evaluate patient treatments and guide the development of new medical interventions and therapies. These tools allow a CRO to quickly and easily receive patient consent for data sharing and gathering, and help parse, filter, and manage data effectively as itâs imported from a given trial. In this blog, weâre exploring the key elements of leveraging technology effectively in clinical research . A CRO that Explores the Best Tech Options for You To put it simply, thereâs no one-size-fits-all solution to clinical research technology. Experienced CROs start with a big-picture strategy that will meet your specific needs. Then, hone in on determining the exact technologies and systems to optimize your research and enable success. As the client, you shouldnât need to make any costly technology overhauls or train staff to learn complex new technologies and software. In a managed service model, your CRO will recommend and implement the technologies that suit the exact specifications and budget of the trial. You should also receive a full assessment of a projectâs budget, scope, and schedule and makes recommendations accordingly. The most trusted CROs are committed to helping clients make the most of their time and money and make a concerted effort to recommend only those solutions that are truly worth your investment. The point is to not only help you achieve your goals but to do so cost-effectively. Leading CROs offer expert assistance from day one to answer questions and share their knowledge whenever you need it. From application management to validation to business accelerator development, you get end-to-end support for the solutions and best practices that empower you to achieve more, sooner. Sifting Through Tech Trends in Clinical Research Just about every new technology promises to ârevolutionize the industry.â With so many options to sift through, pursuing the most appropriate ones can be costly and frequently still leads only to insufficient and suboptimal solutions. Itâs important to note that an honest, reputable CRO will never push the newest, most expensive technologies on you in every situation. The most effective CROs work to understand new and emerging technologies so they can always recommend what is best for the client, based wholly on a complete understanding of their objectives, needs, and limitations. Common Tools Used in Clinical Operations Engagements At the heights of the COVID-19 pandemic, the clinical research industry rapidly pivoted toward decentralized and virtual or siteless trials to try and get back on track after so many delays. Fortunately, we have the technology to empower new methodologies, and these trials bear many benefits. Patients no longer need to travel, eliminating a significant burden for many, and patient consent and opt-in processes have been completely streamlined and simplified. Siteless trials also minimize health risks for all patients involved, many of whom have conditions that heighten their vulnerability to disease. Some of the prominent technologies leveraged today include: â¢ Clinical Trial Training Platforms (eLearning) Virtual clinical trials lack onsite training management, but the flexibility of on-demand learning with a clinical trial training platform enables easily scalable training programs that help reduce risk. â¢ Electronic Data Capture (EDC) EDC platforms enable patients to enter information remotely and secure all participant information and trial data in one place. â¢ Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS) A CTMS is a project management tool tailored to individual clinical operations programs. As the need for virtual and decentralized clinical trial management has exploded, a CTMS is invaluable for managing contacts, documents, calendars, monitoring, site activities, payments, workflows, and much more in a centralized platform. â¢ Electronic Trial Master File (eTMF) The eTMF houses all vital documentation about your clinical trial and provides a clear regulatory overview. â¢ eConsent eConsent solutions offer simple and compliant electronic signature processes with support for media like images, videos, infographics, and more to aid user comprehension. â¢ Electronic Clinical Outcome Assessment (eCOA and ePRO) eCOAs enable clinicians, patients, and site staff to easily input outcomes into the digital system. An ePRO is one type of eCOA that provides outcomes entry data for multiple stakeholders, while ePRO is only for patients. â¢ Supply Management Supply management platforms help with the movement, tracking, and monitoring of all trial materials administered to and received from patients. It manages supply inventory, reordering, and related data management. â¢ Patient Management Software Various software platforms to help simplify, streamline, and optimize patient management throughout clinical trials include: o Electronic Health Record Mining o Televisit Platforms o Patient Engagement o Virtual Site Monitoring Getting Started with the Right CRO There are still a lot of challenges as the industry continues to deploy decentralized, hybrid, and entirely virtual clinical trials. Technology has become the cornerstone for most of our research today, and these clinical trial technology solutions make the process much easier, but the biggest decision youâll have to make is who you trust as your CRO. Thereâs a lot to consider when it comes to choosing the right CRO, but making the right choice doesnât have to be intimidating. With decades of proven quality and results in 30+ therapeutic areas, ClinChoice helps large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with a flexible approach and dedicated teams who enable rapid startups and fast timelines.

The Orphan Drug Act defines a rare disease as a disease or condition that affects less than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, the odds of being affected by one individual rare disease is relatively low. However, when looking at all rare diseases under one umbrella, the odds drastically increase. Ten percent of Americans are affected by any rare disease. While this may seem like a strikingly high percentage, perhaps this next statistic is even more alarming: Ninety-five percent of known rare diseases do not have a drug approved for treatment. The need to develop novel drugs and therapies to treat those suffering from rare diseases is more important than ever.

In E. Lesaffre, G.Baio, & B.Boulanger (Eds.), Bayesian Methods in Pharmaceutical Research (pp. 244). CRC Press. Rare Diseases by the Numbers: There are currently over 500 rare disease drugs in clinical development. The below chart shows a breakdown of these rare disease drugs by therapeutic area: Source: https://www.phrma.org/resource-center/progress-in-fighting-rare-diseases The demand for rare disease prescriptions has steadily increased since 2016 and is expected to continue rising for years. There are many reasons to be optimistic about the future of rare disease drug development. Opportunities for better and faster development include the 1983 Orphan Drug Act, FDA expedited programs for serious conditions and advocacy groups. Due in part to these opportunities, there have been many noteworthy advances in rare disease drug development. Advancements include developing the first treatments of cystic fibrosis, significant advances in targeted therapies for many forms of blood cancer, and developing the first treatments for batten disease, a rare pediatric condition. ClinChoice Contribution to Rare Disease Drug Development ClinChoice has provided statistics and programming services for a multitude of rare disease drugs and is familiar with the methodologies aiming to lessen the complications caused by unclear natural history and small sample size. We routinely provide tests of totality of evidence combining multiple endpoints. Global tests such as Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, OâBrien Test, and Composite Subject-Level Response analyses supplement the separate analyses for individual endpoints. The evidence of treatment effect is explored by both quantification and qualification of endpoint measures. Different simulations compare methods for the parameter of interest based on bias, mean square error, Type 1 error, and statistical power. Rare Disease Day Each year, ClinChoice recognizes Rare Disease Day to raise awareness. In 2022, Rare Disease Day is on February 28 th . Our mission at ClinChoice is to contribute to a healthier and safer world by accelerating the development and commercialization of innovative drugs and devices. Letâs work together to make the world a better place by ending suffering for rare disease patients.

Tiepu Liu, MD, PhD, President of Global Biometrics at ClinChoice, delivered a compelling presentation about our innovative Data Science and Technology solutions. The benefits these solutions provide to our valued clients include better and faster data review and analysis and more informed decision-making. The following is an overview of the general Data Science and Technology services we provide: Overview of the software and technology platforms we utilize to analyze data for our clients: ClinChoice has developed a proprietary data visualization product as part of our biometrics solutions portfolio. This product allows our sponsor clients to view customized, graphic representations of their data in real-time. Our talented data scientists work closely with key personnel at each client to custom tailor our Data Visualization product to your specifications. ClinChoice clients can view a dynamic status dashboard that houses the data from their study. Our programmers integrate the dashboard with other technology that houses your studies data, for example, EDC technology like Medidata RAVE or Oracle Inform. From the dashboard, users can easily navigate and drill down on an individual patient profile. Our clients can easily key into data collected from various sources and identify trends and outliers from this view. Our product also allows for automated analysis and reporting in the form of graphs and charts. These can be extremely useful for signal detection and decision making, such as revealing previously unnoticed key points and assisting decision making.

REVIEW Questions And Answers  OnCustom -made Devices &  Considerations On Adaptable  Medical Devices And Patient - matched Medical DevicesContents INTRODUCTION PERSONALIZED MEDICAL DEVICES: DEFINITIONS AND CATEGORY OVERVIEW CONSIDERATIONS AND APPLICATION OF MDR T O CUSTOM MEDICAL DEVICES CONCLUSIONINTRODUCTION Rapid technological advancements, such as 3 -D printing, have made it possible for  manufacturers to produce personalized medical devices1much faster and on a commercial  scale. The European Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) recently issued a Q&A  document2to help address some of the key regulatory questions and clarify ambiguities  regarding custom -made devices (CMDs) defined in the new EUâs MDR3, and adaptable medical  devices and patient -matched medical devices described by the International Medical Device  Regulators Forum (IMDRF)4. PERSONALIZED MEDICAL DEVICES: DEFINITIONS AND CATEGORY OVERVIEW MDR Article 2(3) defines a CMD as any device specifically made per a written prescription of any  person authorized by national law by virtue of that personâs professional qualifications, which  gives, under that personâs responsibility, specific design characteristics, and is intended for the  sole use of a particular patient exclusively to meet their conditions and needs.5MDCG notes  that an authorized person does not have to be a healthcare professional, but any individual  qualified and authorized according to the Member Stateâs national law. It further clarifies that  the specific design characteristic in the written prescription contains particular information  regarding the design and measured data such as models, dental impressions, material selection  unique to the individual patientâs anatomic -physiological features, and pathological condition. According to MDR Article 2(3), any mass -produced devices adapted to meet the specific  requirements of any professional user and mass -produced devices utilizing industrial  manufacturing processes per the written prescriptions of any authorized person are not  considered CMDs. Since the MDR only provides a definition of CMDs and does not define any  other personalized medical devices that could be, for example, mass -produced, the IMDRF  identified and defined two additional categories of personalized devices: adaptable medical  devices and patient -matching medical devices, respectively. Unlike CMDs, these devices are  typically mass -produced or produced in batches and do not require a written prescription. The  Q&A document notes that the personalized medical devices that do not meet the definition of a  CMD must comply with all relevant sections of the MDR, including conformity assessment,  before placing on the market. 3Adaptable medical devices are intended to be adapted, adjusted, shaped, or assembled per  validated manufacturerâs instructions at the point of care (POC) to meet a patientâs anatomo - physiologic features before use, such as orthotic braces and hearing aids ( otoplastic and  amplifier)6. Per MDR Article 16(1), the individual, usually a healthcare professional, performing  these activities is not considered a manufacturer as long as these modifications do not change  the deviceâs intended purpose or affect its compliance with applicable requirements.  Patient -matched medical devices are intended to be matched to a patientâs anatomy within a  specified design envelope using techniques such as the scaling of the device based on anatomic  references or using the full anatomic features from patient imaging7. For example, 3D printed  implants from a template model, and DICOM files or contact lenses are made to order and  produced in batches.  As described in the Q&A document, in addition to MDR Annex XIII, CMD manufacturers should  ascertain and apply appropriate requirements of Annex I, implement a Quality Management  System (QMS) commensurate to the risk class of the device, and ensure compliance with all  aspects of Article 10(9). For implantable Class III CMDs, a QMS conformity assessment by a  notified body must be performed following either Annex IX Chapter I or Annex XI Part A.  Additionally, as per Annex XIII Section 2, the CMD manufacturers must establish procedures and  document post -market surveillance reports for Class I devices per Article 85 and Periodic Safety  Update Reports (PSURs) for Class IIa, IIb, and III devices per Article 86. However, CMDs are  exempt from UDI requirements, Summary of Safety and Clinical Performance (SSCP)  requirements, and registration of an appointed person responsible for regulatory compliance  (PRRC) in EUDAMED. Furthermore, the Q&A document clarifies when other devices, parts,  components, or materials specifically intended for the manufacture or use with CMDs may be CE  marked and what regulatory considerations for such âintermediate productsâ need to be  considered if placed on the market on their own.  MDCG encourages the application of CMD -related MDR requirements, such as risk  management, post -market surveillance, and clinical evaluation life cycle processes, to CMDs  grouped according to the same intended purpose, materials, and processes, same principal  design among other criteria rather than per each CMD. The International Medical Device  Regulators Forum (IMDRF) Personalized Medical Device âRegulatory Pathways8document  provides recommendations regarding regulatory pathways and considerations for applying  regulatory requirements for CMDs, adaptable medical devices, and patient -matched medical  devices. CONSIDERATIONS AND APPLICATION OF MDR T O CUSTOM MEDICAL DEVICES 4Even though the Q&A answers some of the key regulatory questions related to personalized  medical devices, the manufacturers should be prepared to address the inherent complexities of  device customizations and take into consideration all relevant regulatory requirements (e.g.,  intended purpose, risk class, manufacturing or design changes, manufacturing and use of  personalized medical devices with other CE and non -CE product, among other parameters) to  correctly categorize and classify their device, determine appropriate regulatory pathways, and  maintain regulatory compliance.  In summary, implementing the new MDR regulations and further clarification, including MCDG  documents for the manufacturers of personalized medical devices, may require additional  resources and personnel to ensure compliance with the new regulations and post -market  surveillance. Some of these may include: 1.Experienced regulatory intelligence consultants to interpret and apply the MDR, other  MDCG/IMDRF documents, and national laws 2.Liaisons to engage with Health Authorities or other regulatory agencies on behalf of clients  in the EU and other countries to assist clients in meeting regulatory, compliance, and  manufacturing/post -market laws 3.Robust medical device call center with experienced personnel capable of engaging with  relevant external stakeholders (including patients) to collect, document, and analyze  feedback regarding the devicesâ quality, performance, and safety in the field 4.Compliant infrastructure for incident reporting and experienced authors of required reports  such as Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5.Appointment of a person responsible for regulatory compliance as defined in the new MDRCONCLUSION 56REFERENCES 1,4,6,7 http://www.imdrf.org/docs/imdrf/final/technical/imdrf -tech -181018 -pmd -definitions -n49.pdf 2 https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/default/files/md_sector/docs/mdcg_2021 -3_en.pdf 3,5 https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/ALL/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2017.117.01.0001.01.ENG 8 http://www.imdrf.org/docs/imdrf/final/technical/imdrf -tech -200318 -pmd -rp-n58.pdfABOUT THE AUTHOR Alma brings expertise in regulatory affairs and quality assurance, with over  fifteen years of experience related to medical devices regulations.

The advancements, when coupled with regulatory changes, can be confusing. Thatâs why weâve created this brief review to help clarify the most critical points within recent European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) updates. MDR Article 2(3) defines CMDs as any device specifically made per a prescription lawfully provided by a qualified professional, with specific design characteristics to address that particular patientâs condition or needs. Mass-produced devices adapted to meet the requirements of any professional user and mass-produced devices per the written prescription or an authorized person are not considered CMDS. When it comes to considerations and applications of MDR to custom medical devices, manufacturers should ascertain and apply appropriate regulatory requirements and implement a quality management system commensurate to the type and risk of the device being supplied. Our review further explores post-market surveillance obligations and reports, UDI requirements, and adjacent or intermediary products. Implementing the new MDR requirements and understanding considerations outlined in the MCDG documents for manufacturers of personalized medical devices is complex and may require additional resources and expertise to manage a product through its lifecycle.
