Contact 0 Login CRISPR Gene Editing At SBS Genetech, we are at the forefront
of offering tools for CRISPR Gene Editing, from basic materials to complete
solutions What is CRISPR? A brief introduction of CRISPR gene editing system C
lustered R egularly I nterspaced S hort P alindromic R epeat ( CRISPR ) is a
bacterial defense system that forms the basis for CRISPR/Cas gene-editing
technology. This new gene-editing technology is now becoming a more efficient
and customizable alternative to other existing tools. CRISPR system contains
two components: a CRISPR-associated endonuclease ( Cas nuclease ) and a single
guide RNA ( sgRNA ). Cas protein snips through DNA like a pair of molecular
scissors, and sgRNA directs Cas protein to a specific site of DNA to make the
cut. The protospacer adjacent motif ( PAM ) is a short DNA sequence following
the target cutting site. The PAM is also a prerequisite for a Cas nuclease to
cut. Cas Nucleases Choose the most suitable molecular scissor for your
research Cas13a Nuclease (Lyophilized) Cas13 recognizes and cleaves target RNA
under the guidance of guide RNA, its collateral cleavage activity is
activated, which can efficiently cleave non-specific single-stranded RNA
(ssRNA). The lyophilized version of Cas13a can be transported at room
temperature, saving the high cost of dry ice transportation. Cas12a Nuclease
(Lyophilized) Cas12a (Cpf1) belongs to class II and type VI CRISPR system
effector proteins, and is an endonuclease that binds to and cleavages specific
sites of target DNA under the guidance of single-stranded guide RNA. The
lyophilized version of Cas12a can be transported at room temperature, saving
the high cost of dry ice transportation. Cas9 Cas9 nuclease can form
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with the single guide RNA (sgRNA) component of
the CRISPR/Cas9 system, inducing site-specific DNA double-stranded breaks. The
PAM sequence is NGG. dCas9 dCas9 protein is a ribozyme deficient Cas9 protein,
which does not have sgRNA guided DNA strand cleavage activity, but retains
target DNA binding activity, regulating the gene expression. AapCas12b
AapCas12b is an RNA-mediated endonuclease that binds to and cleaves specific
sites of target DNA under the guidance of single-stranded guide RNA. spCas9-NG
spCas9-NG is an RNA-mediated nuclease, which can catalyze the specific site
cleavage of double-stranded DNA. It can recognize the NG PAM sequence.
LwCas13a When LwCas13a recognizes and cleaves the target RNA under the
guidance of guide RNA, its "accessory cleavage" activity is activated, which
can efficiently cleave non-specific single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) in the
reaction system. SpRYCas9 SpRYCas9 is an RNA-mediated nuclease, which can
catalyze the specific site cleavage of double-stranded DNA. It can recognize
the NNN (NRN > NYN) PAM sequence, which almost gets rid of the restriction of
the PAM. LbaCas12a (Cpf1) LbaCas12a (Cpf1) has a RuvC endonuclease domain
similar to Cas9 but does not have the HNH endonuclease domain. LbaCas12a is
not only smaller than Cas9, but also requires a smaller RNA (nearly half of
Cas9's total sgRNA), which is very helpful for genome editing. Cas14a1
Compared with other Cas proteins, the molecular weight of Cas14 protein is
generally smaller (400-700aa). Similar to Cas12, Cas14a1 can also bind the
target nucleic acid and activate its ssDNA trans cleavage activity. sgRNAs A
programmable GPS from different sources Plasmid-expressed sgRNA 1 st
Generation The sgRNA sequence is first cloned into a plasmid vector and then
introduced into cells by transfection, which is suitable for High-Throughput
Gene Editing . This is the most original method, which requires more than a
week for the preparation before the gene-editing experiment. In Vitro-
transcribed sgRNA 2 nd Generation The sgRNA is first transcribed from a DNA
template by RNA polymerase. Additional purification is then required before
the experiment. Generally, making an In Vitro- transcribed (IVT) sgRNA takes
around 3 days. Synthetic sgRNA 3 rd Generation The sgRNA is directly
synthesized via a chemical approach. Research shows that synthetic sgRNA has
more consistent editing efficiencies and lower off-target effects compared
with plasmid and IVT sgRNAs. Ready for this new experience? Custom Services

of offering high-quality enzymes for lyophilization systems, covering PCR,
CRISPR, and isothermal amplification. The Challenges of Liquid Reagents Strict
Storage Condition As biomacromolecules such as enzymes are easy to denature,
conventional liquid reagents usually require low-temperature storage and
transportation. Loss of Reagents Repeated freeze-thaw cycles will adversely
impact the performance of conventional liquid reagents, which will cause the
loss of the reagents after several times usage. Difficult to Realize
Automation The conventional kit usually contains several liquid components,
requiring a lot of manual pipetting operations, which makes it difficult to be
automated. Freeze-Drying System: Making the Change Convenient All-in-One
System A freeze-drying system can combine all components into a single
microbead. Sometimes only water is required when carrying out the reaction.
The overall operation is greatly simplified, thus no professional technicians
and equipment are required, which is ideal for automation. Easier Storage and
Transportation With freeze-drying technology, the conventional liquid reagents
can be lyophilized into solid microbeads (lyophilized reagent beads, or 'lyo
beads'). These microbeads can be stored and transported at room temperature.

Bst P DNA/RNA Polymerase is an upgraded version of Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase through enzyme electronic re-structure and evolution screening (in silico Design & in vitro Evolution), which is generally used for LAMP or RT-LAMP amplification of DNA or RNA. For more details, please check here: Bst P DNA/RNA Polymerase . Description At SBS Genetech, we are at the forefront of offering solutions for isothermal amplification based on our world-class platform. Our Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is at the core of this platform, which is a mixture of Bst Polymerase and extremely thermostable reverse transcriptase. Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is suitable for isothermal amplification reaction of both DNA and RNA templates, which can detect low-sensitivity nucleic acid templates with great efficiency and specificity. Besides, with a special preparation process, this enzyme has a fast amplification rate and high tolerance to impurity. Since our Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is extremely thermostable and also provides sensitive reverse transcriptase activity, it is reported to have higher sensitivity at high Ct values.

PLoS ONE 17(5): e0268340. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268340 Contents 1,600U DNA/RNA isothermal amplification GC-rich rapid sequencing Rapid sequencing of micro-template DNA Strong Recognition Ability to dUTP Bst DNA/RNA polymerase has a strong recognition ability to dUTP. The dTTP needed for amplification reaction can be completely replaced by dUTP, so the amplification products all contain dUTP. By adding our Heat-Labile Uracil DNA Glycosylase (HL-UDG) , aerosol pollutants will be completely removed in the initial reaction stage. The HL-UDG can be later inactivated irreversibly within 3 min at 65°C, which not only eliminates the pollutants but also ensures the normal amplification of nucleic acid. Therefore, the false positive caused by aerosol pollution in the reaction can be greatly reduced.

almost 20 years of experience in solid-phase peptide synthesis, SBS Genetech
is committed to supplying high-quality custom peptide(s) synthesis services at
competitive prices and providing our customers with extensive services and
products. Get a Quote More Details *This tag is only available for
services/products with more than 500 citations. Description Peptide synthesis
is the synthesis process of peptides in organic chemistry. Peptides are
organic compounds connected by multiple amino acids through peptide bonds. The
manufacturing of peptides can be divided into two ways: chemical synthesis and
biological synthesis. The chemical synthesis methods of peptides can be
divided into two types: liquid-phase peptide synthesis and solid-phase peptide
synthesis. Mechanism The principle of peptide synthesis is by the condensation
of two amino acids in solution. One of the unprotected amino groups reacts
with the other unprotected carboxylic acid group to form a peptide bond. The
second reactive group (amine/acid) in each raw material carries a protective
group. After completing the synthesis of the first amide bond, the protective
group of the amino group (carboxyl group) is removed, and the second amide
bond is synthesized by reacting with the next protective amino acid, and so on
to prolong the peptide chain. Solid-phase Peptide Synthesis Solid-phase
peptide synthesis (SPPs), initiated by Robert Bruce Merrifield, has now become
a recognized organic synthesis method for custom peptide manufacturing in the
laboratory. Solid-phase peptide synthesis has the following advantages:
Synthesize natural peptides that are difficult to express in bacteria Add
unnatural amino acids Modify the peptide/protein skeleton Synthesize proteins
with D configuration The process of solid-phase peptide synthesis is as the
following: Condensation Washing Removing protection Washing With almost 20
years of experience in solid-phase peptide synthesis, SBS Genetech is
committed to supplying high-quality custom peptide(s) synthesis services at
competitive prices and providing our customers with extensive services and
products. Long Peptide Synthesis Long peptide (100-200 residues) synthesis has
always been challenging for conventional chemical synthesis, therefore they
are normally obtained by the expression of E.coli . However, obtaining long
peptides by chemical synthesis will have the advantages of being faster and
cheaper, and the resulting peptide by chemical synthesis is always correct. At
SBS Genetech, we have gained extensive experience in synthesizing these
challenging long peptides. We routinely synthesize long peptides successfully
by various methods, with analytical HPLC chromatograms, MS data, and synthesis
reports provided for validation. With our long peptide synthesis technology,
non-genetically encoded structures, such as D-amino acids, can also be
incorporated into long peptides. Long peptides obtained by chemical synthesis
eliminate problems such as poor or no expression, cloning errors, tags like
FLAG or 6-His, or the mistranslation of non-preferred codons in prokaryotic
hosts. Artificial amino acids that have isosteric side chains can also be used
to investigate the functional importance of specific residues. Features High
Purity : Purities from desalting to >98% Various Modifications : 400+
modifications are available, including Phosphorylation/Biotin-labeled
peptides, Cyclic peptides, KLH/BSA Conjugation, MAP peptides, etc. Long
Peptide Synthesis : The maximum length of peptide synthesis can reach 180
amino acids with our long peptide synthesis technology and various difficult
and complex peptides can be synthesized. High Success Rate : The success rate
exceeds 99%. Turn-around Time : For desalting peptides, the turnaround time is
about 7 working days. For HPLC purified peptides, the turnaround time is about
15 working days. Analytical HPLC chromatograms, MS data, and synthesis reports
are provided. Guarantee: If the synthesis fails due to our reason, no fee will
be charged. Peptide Modifications and Labels Other modifications and labels
are available upon request. SBS Genetech is recognized as one of the global
major leading industry players in Peptide Synthesis by third-party market
researchers. For more details, please visit Peptide Synthesis Market 2017-2022

Contact 0 Login Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) At SBS Genetech,
we are at the forefront of offering solutions for Loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (LAMP) based on our world-class platform It's time for Loop-
mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) Nucleic acid testing technology has
developed rapidly in recent years, especially in the field of molecular
diagnosis. At present, the mainstream of nucleic acid testing techniques in
the market is based on quantitative PCR technology (qPCR), which features
strong specificity and high sensitivity. This technology can quantitatively
detect pathogens and achieve high-throughput detection. However, the
amplification process of qPCR requires thermal cycling instruments. Due to
their large volume, high price, and long reaction time, the application of
thermal cycling instruments in grass-roots units and on-site detection is very
limited. In the past 20 years, scientists have been trying to overcome the
above shortcomings through isothermal amplification, including Rolling Circle
Amplification (RCA), Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP),
Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA), Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based
Amplification (NASBA), Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA), Helicase-
dependent Amplification (HDA), Transcription-mediated Amplification (TMA) and
other isothermal amplification technologies. With these developments,
isothermal amplification is now considered by many researchers and scientists
as a detection method that may be comparable with qPCR technology. Learn More
Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase At the core of our world-class Loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (LAMP) platform Our Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is a mixture of Bst
polymerase and extremely thermostable reverse transcriptase (65°C tolerant),
which is suitable for isothermal amplification reaction (including loop-
mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)) of RNA. It can detect low-
sensitivity RNA molecules. This enzyme is recommended in isothermal
amplification experiments using RNA as a template. In addition, Bst DNA/RNA
Polymerase can also perform isothermal amplification of DNA templates. Learn

Polymerase Anti-contamination Solution PrimeIAmp™ Basic Isothermal
Amplification MasterMix (with UDG) , an upgraded version of PrimeIAmp™ Basic
Isothermal Amplification MasterMix, is a two-component reagent. The buffer mix
contains reaction buffer, Mg 2+ , dU/A/C/GTP (excluding dTTP), and
lyophilization excipient. The enzyme mix contains Bst DNA/RNA polymerase and
heat-labile UDG. Thanks to the recognition of the dUTP substrate by Bst
DNA/RNA Polymerase, the reaction substrate does not contain dTTP, so the
amplified products are dUTP products, which can achieve anti-contamination in
combination with heat-labile UDG. In the actual test, the amplification of
contaminates was completely inhibited under the condition of containing 10 5
copies of contaminates. Learn More Room Temperature Transportation Solution

Contact 0 Login Bst P DNA/RNA System At SBS Genetech, we are at the forefront
of offering solutions for Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) based
on our world-class platform It's time for Bst P DNA/RNA System Thanks to our
molecular enzyme evolution technology platform ( in silico Design & in vitro
Evolution Workflow) and continuous focus on LAMP isothermal amplification
technology, our newly upgraded Bst P DNA/RNA System has pushed LAMP isothermal
amplification technology to a new height. At this moment, Bst P DNA/RNA
Polymerase is one of the best enzymes known for LAMP isothermal amplification.
The whole Bst P DNA/RNA System contains hot start Aptamer, which ensures that
the enzyme activity blocking efficiency is >95% at <30 °C , and the enzyme
activity is completely released within 1 min at >60 °C . This characteristic
is conducive to the establishment of a reaction system at room temperature and
greatly reduces the non-specific amplification at low temperatures . The heat
resistance is further improved to 70 °C . Due to the qualitative improvement
of amplification performance, the difficulty of LAMP primer screening has been
greatly reduced, and it is easier to obtain stable amplification results and
reliable terminal products. The performence of Bst P DNA/RNA System is as
follows: The reaction temperature of the reagent is raised to 70°C, which
provides more rigorous primer matching conditions and greatly reduces the
primer dimer effect. Under this condition, the difficulty of primer screening
is greatly reduced, which is conducive to the primer screening of researchers
and developers. In addition, the high-temperature reaction makes the nucleic
acid release of the crude sample more sufficient, which is easy to be detected
without extraction of nucleic acid, and the inactivation of pathogenic
bacteria is more sufficient. Helicase (unwinding factor) newly developed by us
is added to the reagent so that the formation of the "dumbbell" structure
substrate can be completed by Helicase. Therefore, the F3/B3 primer in the
standard LAMP can be completely removed. At the same time, Helicase has the
function of assisting in strand unwinding, which further reduces the
concentration of FIP/BIP primers. This experimental scheme was established by
our test and named pLAMP (Premium LAMP). HotStart Aptamer with high affinity
ensures that the residual enzyme activity is less than 5% below 30°C , and the
hot start effect is much higher than that of commercial ones. Aptamer with
high affinity makes the reaction system easy to establish and maintain uniform
amplification performance. The newly developed L-HNB colorimetric technology
(Leuco-HNB) solves the problem that the color contrast is not obvious after
the HNB reaction. At the same time, the advantages of the tolerance of HNB to
buffer and sample are retained. The applicability of this colorimetric method
is far better than the visualization method based on pH discoloration. Bst P
DNA/RNA Polymerase Advanced solution for isothermal amplification Bst P
DNA/RNA Polymerase is an upgraded version of Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase through
enzyme electronic re-structure and evolution screening ( in silico Design & in
vitro Evolution), which is generally used for LAMP or RT-LAMP amplification of
DNA or RNA. Learn More Hot Start Proterty With hot start Aptamer, the enzyme
activity blocking efficiency is >95% at <30°C. Reduced Dimer Effect With a
higher reaction temperature (70°C), primer matching conditions will be more
rigorous. Less Primer Usage With additional Helicase, the F3/B3 primer in the
standard LAMP can be completely removed. More Visible Result With Leuco-HNB

Contact 0 Login PCR-Related At SBS Genetech, we are at the forefront of
offering comprehensive solutions for PCR-related products, from basic to
advanced Polymerase Chain Reaction Basics Start with four main components of a
Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) is a method widely
used to rapidly make millions to billions of copies of a specific DNA sample,
allowing scientists to take a very small sample of DNA and amplify it to a
large enough amount to study in detail. There are four main components
required for a reaction: DNA template , DNA primers , free nucleotides called
dNTPs , and DNA polymerase (e.g. U-Taq DNA Polymerase ). At SBS Genetech, we
are at the forefront of offering comprehensive solutions for PCR-Related
products based on our various platforms. DNA template Gene synthesis is an
efficient and cost-effective alternative to molecular cloning for getting your
DNA template. We can synthesize codon-optimized cDNA, gene variants,
artificially designed DNA, or any other sequence for your research. DNA
primers Our oligos are synthesized with a typical coupling efficiency of 99%
and purified by QPC free of charge. PAGE purification is also available with
an additional charge. The high coupling efficiency of our synthesis technology
allows efficient synthesis of oligos up to 120 bases. dNTPs Our dNTPs are
available as ready-to-use mix or sets . Both are free of RNase and DNase and
are suitable for any molecular biology application that requires pure
deoxynucleotides, such as PCR, DNA sequencing, cDNA synthesis, and nick
translation. Purity is more than 99%. DNA polymerase​ We offer comprehensive
DNA polymerases of high quality, from basic U-Taq DNA Polymerase and Pfu DNA
Polymerase to PrimeTaq™ HotStart Direct PCR DNA Polymerase , which features
hot start property and high tolerance to many PCR inhibitors, an ideal enzyme
qualified for almost all scenarios. How to Choose the Right DNA Polymerase
Define the enzyme for your research by following basic properties Fidelity
Defining the ability to discriminate correct vs. incorrect nucleotide
incorporation. The higher the fidelity means the better ability to
"proofread". Extension rate Measuring the speed nucleotides are incorporated
with suitable buffer and temperature. The higher extension rate means the
faster amplification PrimeTaq™ HiFi PCR Polymerase , which is derived from
high fidelity DNA polymerase and added with enhanced extension structure, has
super high fidelity (~ 280 times of Taq DNA Polymerase), long fragment
amplification ability, and higher yield. The polymerase can easily amplify 8
kb genomic DNA, 20 kb λDNA, and 8 kb cDNA. The polymerase has an extension
rate of more than 6 kb/min. The Development of PCR From basic chemical
reaction to advanced statistical analysis The 1 st Generation Traditional PCR
By comparing the intensity of the amplified PCR product on a gel to standards
of a known concentration (usually using DNA Markers ) at the end of the PCR
cycles, the results of qualitative detection are obtained. Traditional PCR
suffers from poor precision and low sensitivity. The 2 nd Generation Real-time
PCR By collecting data during the exponential growth phase of PCR (e.g. signal
from the fluorescent reporter ), the quantity of the PCR product can be
measured as it is directly proportional to the amount of starting template
nucleic acid. Real-time PCR is very precise and specific. The 3 rd Generation
Digital PCR By measuring the fraction of negative replicates, the absolute
copies (e.g. viral load) can be determined by Poisson statistical algorithm.
Digital PCR provides a novel solution for absolute quantification and there
are no references or standards required. Advanced Solutions With PrimeTaq™
series, everything becomes easy and "direct" Direct PCR of DNA from Crude
Sample By PrimeTaq™ HotStart Direct PCR DNA Polymerase PrimeTaq™ HotStart
Direct PCR DNA Polymerase has hot start property and high tolerance to many
PCR inhibitors. High tolerance delivers convenience for DNA amplification by
allowing PCR directly from samples without prior DNA purification. With hot
start property, the polymerase is 100% inactive below 50°C and can be
completely recovered only after heating at 95°C for 5 min. Therefore, the
system can effectively inhibit non-specific PCR amplification, greatly
improving the specificity and sensitivity. The polymerase has 5 '- 3'
exonuclease activity, without 3 '- 5' exonuclease activity. Learn More Direct
PCR of RNA from Crude Sample By PrimeTaq™ HS DP DNA/RNA Polymerase PrimeTaq™
HS DP DNA/RNA Polymerase has hot start property and high tolerance to many PCR
inhibitors. High tolerance delivers convenience for both DNA and RNA
amplification by allowing PCR directly from samples without prior
purification. With hot start property, the polymerase is 100% inactive below
50°C and can be completely recovered only after heating at 92°C for 5 min.
Therefore, the system can effectively inhibit non-specific PCR amplification,
greatly improving the specificity and sensitivity. Learn More Direct
Quantification of DNA from Crude Sample By PrimeTaq™ Probe qPCR MasterMix
PrimeTaq™ Probe qPCR MasterMix, which premixes reagents including chemically
modified PrimeTaq™ HotStart Direct PCR DNA Polymerase, reaction buffer, and
dNTPs. This MasterMix does not contain ROX dyes, which is compatible with a
wide range of fluorescent probes and a variety of quantitative PCR
instruments. In addition, this MasterMix has great performance in multiplex
quantitative PCR (multiplex qPCR) assays, enabling a minimum of 4-plex
quantitative PCR assays. Learn More Direct Quantification of RNA from Crude
Sample By PrimeTaq™ Probe One-Step RT-qPCR MasterMix PrimeTaq™ Probe One-Step
RT-qPCR MasterMix contains PrimeTaq™ HS DP DNA/RNA Polymerase, which has hot
start property and high tolerance to many PCR inhibitors. High tolerance
delivers convenience for both DNA and RNA amplification by allowing PCR
directly from samples without prior purification. With hot start property, the
polymerase is 100% inactive below 50°C and can be completely recovered only
after heating at 92°C for 5 min. Therefore, the system can effectively inhibit
non-specific PCR amplification, greatly improving the specificity and
sensitivity. Learn More Auxiliary Tools We provide powerful auxiliary tools to
make your PCR experiments smoother Heat-Labile Uracil DNA Glycosylase Heat-
Labile Uracil-DNA Glycosylase (HL-UDG) is a recombinant protein expressed by
E. coli which is originally from psychrotrophic marine bacteria. HL-UDG can
achieve optimal anti-contamination ability when adding to the PCR system and
can be irreversibly inactivated by heat denaturation at 95°C for 5 min later,
without affecting subsequent PCR reactions. Based on its unique
characteristic, we have developed PrimeTaq™ Probe qPCR MasterMix (with HL-
UDG), which has excellent performance against nucleic acid aerosol
contamination. Learn More Taq Monoclonal Antibody Taq Monoclonal Antibody is a
highly purified neutralization monoclonal antibody to Taq DNA polymerase. Taq
Monoclonal Antibody binds to Taq DNA polymerase and arrests the activity of
Taq DNA Polymerase, preventing primer dimer formation and non-specific
amplification resulted from non-specific priming at ambient temperature before
the onset of thermal cycling. The antibody is denatured during the initial
denaturation step, so there is no need for a special denaturation step. Learn
More 5 × GC Solution GC-Solution is an auxiliary reagent for gene
amplification. It is mainly used for PCR amplification of high GC content
templates (> 70%) and long fragments (> 4 kb). It can reduce primer-dimer and
nonspecific amplification and thus improve amplification efficiency. GC-
solution will affect the stability of primer-template pairing, so please don’t
add it if unnecessary. The minimum shelf life is 2 years at -20°C. Learn More

DNA to RNA A strand of DNA is used as a template for synthesizing a strand of
RNA by RNA polymerase (e.g. T7 Thermostable RNA Polymerase ). During this
process, RNA polymerase binds to a site called the promoter and starts copying
the nucleotides, where deoxyribonucleotides are replaced by ribonucleotides .
Reverse Transcription of RNA to DNA Complementary DNA (cDNA) is generated from
an RNA template by reverse transcriptase (e.g. Ultra Thermo-stable M-MLV
Reverse Transcriptase ). During this process, RNasin is usually used to
prevent the degradation of the RNA templates. Evolution of Reverse

Contact 0 Login RNA Silencing At SBS Genetech, we are at the forefront of
offering high-quality siRNA and transfection reagents, facilitating the
readiness of successful RNA silencing. What is RNA Silencing? RNA Silencing is
a conserved RNA-mediated and sequence-specific gene silencing effect by which
gene expression is down-regulated by either microRNA (miRNA) or small
interfering RNA (siRNA) miRNA A small single-stranded non-coding RNA molecule
Endogenously expressed Inhibit translation of multiple mRNA targets 19-25
nucleotides siRNA A small double-stranded non-coding RNA molecule Exogenously
derived Highly specific with only one mRNA target 21-23 nucleotides RNA
Silencing Mechanism dsRNA is first degraded by Dicer (a highly conserved
RNase) into siRNA (~22 bp). siRNA binds to RISC (RNA Induced Silencing
Complex) to form siRNA-Protein Complex. The Complex cleaves mRNA with a
complementary sequence, inhibiting downstream expression. A Successful RNA
Silencing Expriment Transfection Methods The common methods of mammalian
transfection include: calcium phosphate coprecipitation electroporation
microinjection gene gun liposome transfection etc Currently, liposome
transfection is most commonly used. Notes for Liposome Transfection Several
aspects need to be paid attention to for liposome transfection: the type and
dosage of transfection reagent the type and dosage of siRNA the cell density
the operation sequence the water bath timing of cells and siRNA-transfection
reagent complex Chemically Modified siRNA The most difficult problem of RNAi
technology is the stability of siRNA. Here, with chemical modification, our
chemically modified siRNA has much higher stability than the common siRNA. The
chemical modification not only enhances the life span of siRNA in serum and
cell culture but also enhances its activity in vitro . Sirnafectamine
Transfection Reagent Sirnafectamine is a new generation of the RNA
transfection reagent, which can be used in RNA transfection experiments.
Sirnafectamine accelerates the binding of glycoprotein on cell membrane, which
promotes the endocytosis of cells. In addition, compared with other siRNA
transfection reagents, Sirnafectamine has minimal cytotoxicity and the best
cell state after transfection. RNA Silencing Products Buy now Fluorescently

Contact 0 Login Exosome At SBS Genetech, we are at the forefront of offering
cutting-edge solutions for exosome extraction and exsome extracts. What is
Exosome? Exosomes are vesicular structures secreted by cells into the
extracellular environment, typically ranging in diameter from 30 to 150 nm.
They possess a characteristic lipid bilayer membrane structure and can be
found in cell culture supernatants, plasma, serum, saliva, urine, amniotic
fluid, malignant ascites, and other biological fluids. Exosomes carry a
variety of proteins, lipids, DNA, and RNA from their parent cells, containing
essential information crucial for intercellular substance and information
transfer. They play a significant role in cell-to-cell communication.
Advantages of Exosomes Safety Exosomes have lower immunogenicity, which can
avoid triggering immune rejection reactions, greatly enhancing safety.
Stability Exosomes can protect their contents from degradation, thus
preventing the loss of activity of certain active ingredients. Scalability
Exosomes can be abundantly enriched in culture media. Controllability The
function of exosomes can be altered by changing the cellular environment.

Therapy (IF: 13)! A novel mRNA-based therapeutic HPV vaccine, mHTV-03E2,
demonstrates promising efficacy in targeting high-risk HPV-associated
malignancies, offering a potential breakthrough in cancer treatment. · News,
Publications On May 5, 2024, a team of researchers including Jing Wang, Ling
Ma, Kai Lv, Rui Zhou, Dongrong Yi, Qian Liu, Yongxin Zhang, Xiaoyu Li,
Tingting Cheng, and Shan Cen from the Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology,
Chinese Academy of Medical Science, collaborated with scientists from
RinuaGene Biotechnology Co., Ltd., including Qixin Wang, Yi Wang, Tingting
Zhang, Jinming Zhang, Chunjian Huang, Yijie Dong, and Weiguo Zhang, published
a research paper titled "Development of an mRNA-based therapeutic vaccine
mHTV-03E2 for high-risk HPV related malignancies" in Molecular Therapy (impact
factor: 12.91). In this study, the research team have successfully developed a
novel mRNA-based therapeutic HPV vaccine, named mHTV-03E2, targeting high-risk
HPV-associated malignancies. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections,
particularly HPV 16 and 18, are implicated in numerous human cancers. Despite
the availability of preventive vaccines for high-risk HPV strains, there
remains an urgent need for therapeutic HPV vaccines to address existing high-
risk HPV infections and lesions. Utilizing lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology
for efficient mRNA delivery, the team developed the mHTV-03E2 vaccine
targeting the E2/E6/E7 proteins of both HPV16 and HPV18. The vaccine
significantly induced antigen-specific cellular immune responses, leading to
notable infiltration of CD8+ T cells and enhanced cytotoxicity within tumors.
This resulted in remarkable tumor regression and prolonged animal survival in
a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, sustained T cell immunity against
HPV16/18 E6/E7 antigens was observed for up to 4 months post-vaccination,
indicating the vaccine's potential for preventing tumor relapse. Additionally,
when combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, mHTV-03E2 showed
synergistic effects in inhibiting tumor growth and extending animal survival,
suggesting promising prospects for combination therapy. In conjunction with
the research study, a set of peptides spanning the HPV16/18 E2, E6 and E7
antigens, each containing 15 amino acid residues overlapping by eight amino
acids, were synthesized from SBS Genetech. Since 2000, SBS Genetech has been
at the forefront of providing solutions in life sciences. We offer safer,
superior quality, and more cost-effective products to preeminent researchers

ADVANCES (IF: 15)! This study reveals the suppressive role of FoxA1 in liver
cancer and identifies IKBKE as a key regulator, offering a promising strategy
for targeted therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma. February 10, 2024 ·
Publications, News Physiologically, FoxA1 plays a key role in liver
differentiation and development, and pathologically exhibits an oncogenic role
in prostate and breast cancers. However, its role and upstream regulation in
liver tumorigenesis remain unclear. On February 7, 2024, Jianping Guo, Lixia
Xu, Wei Xie from Sun Yat-sen University, and Ying Liang from Guangzhou Medical
University, co-corresponding authors, published a research paper titled
"Atypical inflammatory kinase IKBKE phosphorylates and inactivates FoxA1 to
promote liver tumorigenesis" online in Science Advances (impact factor:
14.98). This study demonstrated the suppressive role of FoxA1 in liver cancer.
Using a CRISPR-based kinome screening approach, they found that the
noncanonical inflammatory kinase IKBKE can inhibit FoxA1's transcriptional
activity. It is noteworthy that IKBKE directly binds to and phosphorylates
FoxA1, reducing its complex formation and DNA interaction, resulting in an
increase in hepatocellular malignancies. Knock-in mice with non-phosphorylated
mimic Foxa1 significantly delayed liver tumor occurrence in hydrodynamic
transfection murine models, while knock-in mice with phospho-mimic Foxa1
phenocopied Foxa1 knockout mice, exhibiting developmental defects and liver
inflammation. Importantly, Ikbke knockout delayed the development of

Congratulations to Our Customer for Published in Nature... Return to site
Return to site Congratulations to Our Customer for Published in Nature
Communications (IF: 18)! The study unveils a critical insight into the
mechanics of tumor progression, especially concerning the PI3K/AKT signaling
pathway. It specifically emphasizes the role of NLRP6 in enhancing
tumorigenesis by promoting the autophagic degradation of p85α. October 1, 2023
· News, Publications On September 28th, a breakthrough paper was published by
researchers from Sun Yat-sen University and Soochow University in the
prominent journal Nature Communications (impactful factor: 17.694). The
research, entitled “ NLRP6 Potentiates PI3K/AKT Signalling by Promoting
Autophagic Degradation of p85α to Drive Tumorigenesis ,” elucidates a novel
therapeutic strategy against tumors by disrupting the interaction between
NLRP6 and p85α to inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway. The robust system of innate
immunity serves as the organism's initial shield against pathogens,
recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through a series of
pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These PRRs, which include the likes of
C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), Toll-like
receptors (TLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), function not only to thwart
infection but also to safeguard internal stability. Zooming in on NLRs, they
emerge as a specialized category of intracellular proteins capable of
identifying a diverse array of ligands emanating from microbial pathogens,
host cells, and environmental sources, thereby playing a pivotal role in
orchestrating the innate immune response. While a wealth of studies have
delved into the role of various NLRs—such as NOD1, NOD2, and NLRP3—in
activating innate immune signaling pathways, with NOD1 and NOD2 known to
activate the NF-κB signaling pathway upon encountering their respective PAMPs,
the direct interaction of NLRs with subunits of PI3K, influencing the PI3K/AKT
signaling pathway in gliomas, remains unverified. In the burgeoning field of
protein interactions as potential therapeutic targets, the alpha-helix has
established itself as a crucial recognition element, providing a promising
inhibitory model for macromolecule interactions. The research brings to light
the fact that NLRP6 promotes the degradation of p85α by establishing a direct
interaction with it, consequently propelling tumor growth. The study
introduces a compelling anti-tumor effect by interfering with the NLRP6/p85α
interaction via Pep9. It highlights that NLRP6, serving as a bridging protein
that interacts with p85α, recruits RBX1 to ubiquitinate p85α through the OPTN-
mediated autophagic degradation pathway, subsequently activating the PI3K/AKT
signaling pathway to fuel tumor progression. Providing a concrete foundation,
the research validates that rupturing the interaction between NLRP6 and p85α
to obstruct the PI3K/AKT pathway may unfurl as an effective strategy in tumor
combat. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41739-z In conjunction with the
research study, the site-directed mutagenesis kit utilized was supplied by SBS

Endonuclease I (T7 Endo I, T7EI) is a relatively unique DNA endonuclease that
can recognize and cleave non-perfectly matched DNA, cruciform DNA structures,
Holliday structures or junctions, and heteroduplex DNA. T7EI cleaves the sites
located at the first, second, or third phosphodiester bond at the 5' end of
mismatched bases. Additionally, T7EI can also cleave nicked double-stranded
DNA at a slow rate. This product is commonly used for identifying gene
mutations induced by CRISPR/Cas9 and other methods. Select Select 250U 1250U

(for 5000U) Description T7 Endonuclease I (T7 Endo I, T7EI) is a relatively
unique DNA endonuclease that can recognize and cleave non-perfectly matched
DNA, cruciform DNA structures, Holliday structures or junctions, and
heteroduplex DNA. T7EI cleaves the sites located at the first, second, or
third phosphodiester bond at the 5' end of mismatched bases. Additionally,
T7EI can also cleave nicked double-stranded DNA at a slow rate. This product
is commonly used for identifying gene mutations induced by CRISPR/Cas9 and
other methods. It is important to note that T7EI can recognize mismatches in
DNA caused by insertions, deletions, or mutations of length greater than or
equal to 2 base pairs (bp) but cannot recognize 1-bp insertions, deletions, or
mutations. Application T7 Endonuclease I (T7 Endo I, T7EI) is commonly used
for detecting mutations induced by CRISPR/Cas9, TALENs, or other gene editing
tools. It is also utilized for the detection of gene point mutations and
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Furthermore, T7EI can be employed to
cleave four-way junctions or branched DNA, as well as to detect or cleave
heteroduplex and nicked DNA. Additionally, it is used for random cleavage of
linear DNA, which involves partially paired double-stranded DNA formed within
or between linear DNA molecules, for applications such as shotgun cloning and
sequencing. Source Recombinant protein of T7 bacteriophage gene 3 expressed in
Escherichia coli. Activity Definition One unit is defined as the amount of
enzyme required to convert > 90% of 1 μg of supercoiled cruciform pUC(AT) DNA
to > 90% linear form in a total reaction volume of 50 μl within 1 hour at
37°C. 10X Reaction Buffer 500 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM MgCl2, 10 mM
DTT, pH 7.9. Purity Purity is greater than 95%. The enzyme does not contain
any DNA endonuclease or exonuclease other than T7 Endonuclease I, RNAse, or
phosphatases. Inactivation or Inhibition T7EI can be inactivated by heating at
85°C for 15 minutes or by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mM.
Storage Store at -20°C, valid for at least one year. Precautions T7
Endonuclease I (T7EI) is an enzyme that depends on substrate structure for
selective cleavage, and it exhibits different reaction activities with
different DNA substrates. Therefore, when cutting specific substrates, it is
essential to control the enzyme amount and reaction time. If the reaction
temperature exceeds 42°C, it may increase non-specific cleavage activity,
while temperatures exceeding 55°C can reduce its enzyme activity. This product
is intended for scientific research by professionals only and must not be used
for clinical diagnosis or treatment, food or drugs, and should not be stored
in regular residential areas. For your safety and health, please wear lab
coats and disposable gloves during handling. Only for research and not

proteases are a general class of enzymes that specifically remove the post-
translational protein modification (PTM) known as small ubiquitin-related
modifier (SUMO), which falls into the PTM class of ubiquitin and/or ubiquitin-
like proteins (UBL). The enzyme commonly referred to as ‘SUMO protease’ is the
Ubl-specific protease 1 (Ulp1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This was the
first of this class of enzymes to be isolated. Select Select 1000U 5000U
Quantity Coming soon Add to cart More Details All products have special prices
for bulk purchase, please contact for more details if required. Cat. No.:
SUMO-1k (for 1,000U) Cat. No.: SUMO-5k (for 5,000U) Description SUMO protease
specifically cleaves the SUMO moiety in a ‘scarless’ manner. SUMO protease
recognizes the tertiary structure of the Ubiquitin-like SUMO domain and
hydrolyzes the peptide bond in the x–Gly–Gly–x sequence after the Gly-Gly
bond, at the C -terminus of the SUMO domain. In addition to the cleavage of
natural SUMO-modified proteins, SUMO protease is used to cleave recombinant
SUMO fusion proteins. The SUMO domain is a known solubility-enhancing fusion
tag used in recombinant protein expression. A histidine tag can also be added
at the N -terminus of the SUMO domain as a purification tag. This SUMO
protease product carries a 6x histidine tag. Thus it can be easily removed
together with the cleaved SUMO domain, following the digestion reaction SUMO
protease is active over a wide range of temperatures (2–30 °C), ionic
strengths (0–400 mM NaCl), and pH ranges (6–8.5). However, its activity may
vary depending on the substrate and conditions. Researchers will need to
optimize their specific reaction conditions. As an initial suggestion, 20
units of SUMO protease can be used per mg of target protein for 1 hour at 30
°C, or overnight at 2–8 °C. The cleavage efficiency can then be estimated by
SDS-PAGE. If necessary, the amount of SUMO protease can then be adjusted. SUMO
protease works better in the presence of reducing agents, e.g., 0.5–2 mM DTT.
DTT in the reaction mixture can significantly enhance cleavage efficiency,
especially during longer incubations Unite definition In 1 x SUMO Buffer-Salt
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% NP-40, 1 mM DTT), the amount of enzyme required
to cleave >85% of the 2 µg control substrate at 30 °C for 1 h is defined as an
active unit. Storage SUMO Protease can be stored for 2 years at -80 °C for a
long time or for 6 months at -20 °C after sub-packaged to avoid repeated
freezing and thawing. 10 x SUMO Buffer+/-Salt can be stored at -20 °C.
Protocol If the protein is thermally unstable, incubate at 4 °C for a longer
time or increase the amount of enzyme used. Set up the following reaction
system in EP tube: After mixing the system, incubate at 30 °C. Take 30 μl
solution at 1, 2, 4, and 6 h respectively, and place it in a separate EP tube.
Add 20 μl 2 x SDS Loading Buffer to the above EP tube and place it at -20 °C.
Take 30 μl sample for SDA-PAGE analysis. Note 10 x SUMO Buffer + Salt: 500 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2% Igepal (NP-40), 1.5 M NaCl, 10 mM DTT. 10 x SUMO Buffer-
Salt: 500 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2% Igepal (NP-40), 10 mM DTT. Please select the
appropriate buffer according to the experiments. To achieve the best digestion
result, please ensure that the recombinant protein is partially or completely
purified. For different fusion proteins, the concentration of NaCl required by
SUMO protease will vary and can be adjusted between 0-300 mM. Only for

No.: RNH-1k (for 1000U) Cat. No.: RNH-5k (for 5000U) Description RNase H, also
known as Ribonuclease H, is a ribonucleic acid endonuclease obtained through
expression and purification from Escherichia coli. It specifically hydrolyzes
the RNA in DNA-RNA hybrid chains. RNase H cannot hydrolyze the phosphodiester
bonds in single-stranded or double-stranded DNA or RNA, which means it cannot
digest single-stranded or double-stranded DNA or RNA. RNase H is widely used
to digest and degrade RNA in DNA-RNA hybrid double-strands formed after the
synthesis of the second strand of cDNA, or to remove mRNA poly(A) hybridized
to oligo (dT), among other applications. Features It specifically digests RNA
in DNA-RNA hybrid chains and is commonly used in the synthesis of the second
strand of cDNA. Applications Removal of RNA from DNA-RNA hybrid chains, such
as pre-removal of RNA before the synthesis of the second strand of cDNA;
removal of RNA after the synthesis of the first strand of cDNA in RT-PCR/RT-
qPCR experiments; site-specific cleavage of RNA using complementary DNA
sequences; removal of poly(A) from mRNA hybridized to poly(dT); studies of
products in vitro polyadenylation reactions; identification of DNA-RNA hybrid
double-strands. Source Purified from recombinant E. coli strains carrying the
gene encoding RNase H from Escherichia coli. Molecular weight Approximately
18.4 kDa (monomer). Activity definition One unit is defined as the amount of
enzyme required to produce 1 nmol of ribonucleotides from 20 picomoles of a
fluorescently labeled 50 base pair RNA-DNA hybrid in a total reaction volume
of 50 µl in 20 minutes at 37°C. Inactivation or inhibition RNase H can be
inactivated by heating at 65°C for 10 minutes. Metal ion chelators and thiol-
blocking agents can inhibit RNase H activity. Addition of EDTA to a final
concentration of at least 5 mM can inhibit the enzymatic activity of RNase H.
Precautions When using the enzyme, it should be stored in an icebox or on an
ice bath. After use, it should be immediately stored at -20°C. This product is
intended for scientific research purposes by professionals only. It is not to
be used for clinical diagnosis or treatment, and should not be used in food or

- $900.00 T5 exonuclease degrades DNA along with the 5'→3' direction, which
degrades double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA, and nicked plasmid DNA. It
can degrade DNA both from the 5'-end and from the cut or notch of linear or
circular double-stranded DNA, but it cannot degrade superhelical double-
stranded DNA. Based on the above characteristics, T5 exonuclease can be
applied to the Gibson assembly. Select Select 1000U 5KU 20KU Quantity Coming

purchase, please contact for more details if required. Cat. No.: T5EX-1k (for
1,000U) Cat. No.: T5EX-5k (for 5KU) Cat. No.: T5EX-20k (for 20KU) The
lyophilized T5 Exonuclease is also available by inquiry, which can be
transported at room temperature. Description T5 Exonuclease is a type of
exonuclease that degrades double-stranded or single-stranded DNA in the 5'→3'
direction. T5 Exonuclease can initiate digestion from the 5' end of single-
stranded or double-stranded DNA and can also start digestion from the gaps or
nicks in linear or circular double-stranded DNA. T5 Exonuclease cannot degrade
supercoiled double-stranded DNA, and its activity in degrading single-stranded
DNA can be inhibited by reducing the Mg2+ concentration in the reaction buffer
to below 1mM. Based on these characteristics, T5 Exonuclease is commonly used
in Gibson Assembly. Gibson Assembly is a technique used to efficiently connect
multiple overlapping DNA fragments under isothermal conditions. The basic
principle of Gibson Assembly can be summarized in three steps: (1) T5 DNA
exonuclease initiates digestion from the 5' end of DNA fragments, generating
complementary single-stranded 3' overhangs that facilitate annealing of
complementary ends; (2) DNA polymerase fills in the gaps created by annealing;
(3) DNA ligase connects the assembled fragments at the nicks, resulting in a
complete double-stranded DNA. Application T5 Exonuclease is commonly used in
Gibson Assembly, degradation of linear single-stranded, double-stranded, or
nicked plasmid DNA, removal of incomplete ligation products from circular
double-stranded DNA, degradation of linear and nicked plasmid DNA to obtain
high-purity supercoiled plasmid DNA, removal of denatured plasmid DNA
generated during alkaline extraction of plasmids, and improvement of
transfection efficiency of small-scale purified plasmid cDNA libraries. Source
Purified from E. coli strains expressing the T5 bacteriophage D15 gene
plasmid. Activity Definition One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme
required to produce 1 nmol of acid-soluble deoxyribonucleotide from double-
stranded DNA in 30 minutes at 37°C in a total reaction volume of 50 µl. Purity
The enzyme does not contain any DNA endonucleases or exonucleases other than
T5 Exonuclease, RNAse, or phosphatases. Enzyme Storage Buffer 50mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5, 25°C), 100mM NaCl, 1mM DTT, 0.1mM EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50%
(v/v) Glycerol. 10X Reaction Buffer 200mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.9, 25°C), 500mM
Potassium Acetate, 100mM Magnesium Acetate, 10mM DTT. Inactivation or
Inhibition T5 Exonuclease can be inactivated by adding EDTA to a final
concentration of at least 11mM or by using DNA loading buffer containing SDS
(final SDS concentration is 0.08%). Storage The minimum shelf life is 3 years
at -20°C. Precaution T5 Exonuclease is a selectively acting DNA exonuclease
that exhibits different reaction activities with different DNA substrates.
Therefore, when digesting specific substrates, it is important to properly
control the enzyme amount and reaction time. The optimal reaction temperature
for T5 Exonuclease is 37°C, but it also has some activity at 50°C, making it
suitable for use in Gibson Assembly. T5 Exonuclease also exhibits activity in
regular PCR buffers. This product is intended for scientific research by
professionals only and must not be used for clinical diagnosis or treatment,
food or drugs, and should not be stored in regular residential areas. For your

dephosphorylation of 5'and 3' phospholipids of DNA and RNA and also hydrolyzes
ribose and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (NTP and dNTP). The enzyme is
widely used in molecular biology research, such as removing phosphate groups
at DNA and RNA ends for subsequent cloning and probe end labeling. Select
Select 5,000U 50 KU Quantity Coming soon Add to cart More Details All products
have special prices for bulk purchase, please contact for more details if
required. Cat. No.: SAP-5k (for 5KU) Cat. No.: SAP-50k (for 50KU) Description
In cloning, the vector is dephosphorylated by shrimp alkaline phosphatase and
can not be linked to its 3' end because there is no phosphate group at the 5'
end. Shrimp alkaline phosphatase can act on both 5' sticky ends and blunt
ends, and can also be used to degrade free dNTP in PCR reaction for
preparation of sequencing template and SNP analysis. The shrimp alkaline
phosphatase can be completely and irreversibly inactivated by incubation at
65°C for 5 min, so there is no need to remove it after ligation or end
labeling. Based on above properties, this enzyme is an excellent alternative
to the traditional dephosphorylase, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase.
Components Application Dephosphorylation of DNA and RNA Preventing self-
ligation of cloning vectors Preparation of 5' end labeling template Removal of
dNTP and pyrophosphate from PCR products Unit Definition A unit is the amount
of enzyme required to dephosphorylate 1 μg of pUC19 DNA digested by HindIII
(producing a 5' protruding end) at 25°C for 30 min. The dephosphorylation
criterion refers to the inhibition of DNA reconnection by more than 95% in the
self-ligation reaction. Storage The minimum shelf life is 3 years at -20°C.

industrial-grade circular mRNA synthesis services for vaccine development. We
welcome inquiries and collaborations! Get a Quote More Details Description
Circular RNA (circRNA) is an RNA molecule that forms a circular structure
through typical 5’-3’ phosphodiester bonds. CircRNA is a naturally occurring
single-stranded circular RNA found in organisms, often generated during
processes such as intron reverse splicing (trans-splicing). Research on
circular RNA can be conducted using plasmid or viral expression methods, which
can then produce circRNA through processes such as reverse splicing. However,
the auxiliary processes involved in generating circRNA via plasmids or
viruses, such as reverse splicing, may potentially interfere with research
results. Direct transfection synthesis of circRNA allows for a more direct
study of circRNA's biological functions. Recent studies have shown that
circRNA technology has significant advantages in vaccine development: compared
to linear RNA, circRNA is resistant to degradation mediated by nucleases, has
a longer half-life, and higher stability. Additionally, circRNA can avoid
triggering TLR/RIG-I-mediated immune responses, reducing the likelihood of
adverse reactions. Furthermore, circRNA does not require expensive modified
nucleotides, potentially greatly reducing the cost of mRNA vaccines. We have
independently developed an efficient circRNA synthesis kit with high
circularization efficiency and ease of operation, allowing for the convenient
generation of circular RNA. Customers only need to provide the sequence, and
we can offer a one-stop service from RNA synthesis to circularization. We also
accept linear RNA products provided by customers and offer subsequent

LC-dsDNA (Linear, covalent closed, double-strand DNA), also known as linear
covalently closed double-stranded DNA, possesses free, non-cohesive 3' and 5'
ends, making it a small, linear double-stranded DNA structure. LC-dsDNA lacks
scaffold information and serves solely for the expression of target genes. Due
to its small molecular weight, it exhibits high efficiency in cell
transfection. Moreover, its ability to trigger levels of humoral and cellular
immunity comparable to those achieved by plasmid DNA vaccines in antigen
expression and in vivo murine models offers effective protection against viral
infections. Introducing LC-dsDNA into target cells enables the introduction
and expression of specific genes within cells, offering significant advantages
in clinical applications and safety. Get a Quote More Details Description
Plasmid DNA, as a non-viral vector for gene delivery, has wide applications in
preventive vaccines for infectious diseases, tumor therapy, protein
replacement therapy, and other fields. However, therapeutic plasmid DNA faces
several challenges. There are risks associated with the integration of plasmid
DNA into the genome of target cells. CpG motifs present in plasmid DNA
sequences may have immune-stimulating effects. Bacteria present in the human
body may undergo plasmid transformation, leading to plasmid DNA replication
and bacterial development of resistance. Additionally, DNA fragments
containing only transcription units obtained by restriction enzyme digestion
or PCR amplification are highly susceptible to degradation by nucleases. LC-
dsDNA (Linear, covalent closed, double-strand DNA), also known as linear
covalently closed double-stranded DNA, possesses free, non-cohesive 3' and 5'
ends, making it a small, linear double-stranded DNA structure. LC-dsDNA lacks
scaffold information and serves solely for the expression of target genes. Due
to its small molecular weight, it exhibits high efficiency in cell
transfection. Moreover, its ability to trigger levels of humoral and cellular
immunity comparable to those achieved by plasmid DNA vaccines in antigen
expression and in vivo murine models offers effective protection against viral
infections. Introducing LC-dsDNA into target cells enables the introduction
and expression of specific genes within cells, offering significant advantages
in clinical applications and safety. Features Compared to traditional DNA
plasmids, LC-dsDNA has the following advantages: Elimination of plasmid
backbone and irrelevant exogenous sequences reduces risks, resulting in higher
safety. Reduction of CpG motifs lowers the risk of triggering immune
responses. Not influenced by plasmid backbone copy numbers, leading to higher
yields. Better expression in mammalian organisms, requiring less DNA for each
transfection. In contrast to DNA fragments obtained through PCR amplification
or enzyme digestion, LC-dsDNA forms a covalently closed structure with self-
circularization at the 3' end, making it resistant to nuclease degradation and
thus exhibiting higher stability. Deliverable We have extensive experience in
custom synthesis of research-grade LC-dsDNA and offer one-stop services
including gene synthesis, plasmid preparation, and LC-dsDNA synthesis. We can
synthesize LC-dsDNA ranging from 200 to 8000 base pairs and optimize
customization for various downstream applications. Our delivered products

services for 70-150 polyA templates. Gene Editing : LC-dsDNA can serve as a
homology-directed repair (HDR) template for gene knock-in in CRISPR/Cas gene
editing technology. With linear closed-end structure, it is resistant to
cellular nucleases, enhancing editing efficiency, while the closed structure
reduces the risk of non-homologous end joining. Non-viral Vector for Gene

Powder, NBT Powder, and 4-nitrophenylphosphate disodium salt hexahydrate
(phosphatase substrate pNPP Powder). Get a Quote More Details
5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indole phosphate p-toluidine salt (BCIP) Powder BCIP can be
used as a substrate for alkaline phosphatase. The reaction product is blue and
insoluble in water. For color detection of alkaline phosphatase-labeled
molecules, a combination reaction of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate
(BCIP) and nitrobluetetrazole (NBT) is commonly used. NBT Powder NBT is a
chromogenic substrate of alkaline phosphatase (AP) and is converted into
indigo/purple products under its action. Alkaline phosphatase hydrolyzes
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indole phosphate (BCIP) to produce indigo white, which is
then reduced by NBT to form insoluble blue BCI. 4-nitrophenylphosphate
disodium salt hexahydrate (phosphatase substrate pNPP Powder) pNPP can be used
for colorimetric substrates in alkaline and acidic phosphatase ELISA
experiments. The soluble final product produced by the reaction is yellow, and
the absorbance at 405nm can be read in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) reader. Related: Single-Component TMB ELISA Substrate Two-Component

quenchers for Taqman probes. Taqman probes with quenchers and a variety of
different fluorescent reporters can be conveniently ordered from us. All
Taqman probes provided are HPLC purified. Get a Quote More Details With the
use of high-throughput DNA independent synthesis technology, we are able to
individually synthesize and recover each sequence with astounding efficiency,
while controlling the synthesis yield at the pmol level. For more information,
please visit pmol-scale DNA Capture Probe Synthesis Service . Description
Taqman probes have a fluorescent reporter and a quencher at their 5' and 3'
ends, respectively. These probes can be used in quantitative PCR systems that
take advantage of the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase (Figure
1). A probe specific for the sequence of interest is used in PCR together with
specific PCR primers. This probe is designed to anneal between the PCR
primers. During the extension phase of PCR, the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of
Taq DNA polymerase cleaves the fluorescent reporter from the probe. The amount
of free reporter accumulates as the number of PCR cycles increases. The
fluorescent signal from the free reporter is measured in real-time and allows
quantification of the amount of target sequence. Turn-around time is about 3-4
working days. We can also provide industrial-grade (up to 50,000OD) probes
with high quality and competitive pricing. Please contact us for more details.

in probe length, the quenching efficiency of single-quenched probes
diminishes, while the emergence of double-quenched probes effectively
addresses this issue. Conventional probes carry a fluorescent moiety at the 5'
end and a quencher at the 3' end. SBS Genetech's introduction of double-
quenched probes involves the addition of an extra quencher moiety within the
conventional probe, reducing fluorescence "leakage". This enhancement enables
the attainment of lower fluorescent background signals in experiments, thereby
enhancing detection sensitivity. Get a Quote More Details Description With the
increase in probe length, the quenching efficiency of single-quenched probes
diminishes, while the emergence of double-quenched probes effectively
addresses this issue. Conventional probes carry a fluorescent moiety at the 5'
end and a quencher at the 3' end. SBS Genetech's introduction of double-
quenched probes involves the addition of an extra quencher moiety within the
conventional probe, reducing fluorescence "leakage". This enhancement enables
the attainment of lower fluorescent background signals in experiments, thereby
enhancing detection sensitivity. Advantages The utilization of high-quality
fluorescent probes can significantly enhance assay efficiency and detection
accuracy. Evaluation criteria for these probes primarily encompass
selectivity, sensitivity, response speed, fluorescence enhancement factor,
stability, and biocompatibility. Notably, conventional nucleic acid probes
exhibit only one type of fluorescence quenching effect! The effectiveness of
the quencher moiety in extinguishing fluorescence relies on distance;
proximity results in efficient quenching, whereas greater separation leads to
diminished quenching and heightened background fluorescence signals. Double-
quenched probes offer a compelling solution to this "distance" challenge,
thereby markedly improving qPCR assays! The dual-quenching mechanism
effectively reduces background signals, enhancing sensitivity. It reduces
fluorescence signal crosstalk in multi-channel detection, ensuring
compatibility. Probe lengths can be designed up to 40 nucleotides, offering
improved selectivity. Comparison Performance Conventional Probe Double-

Powder We have developed an exosome lyophilization protection agent. After
vacuum freeze-drying, the resulting exosome lyophilized powder can be stored
for an extended period at 4°C. Upon reconstitution, it retains the original
exosome morphology and biological activity, making it a highly practical
method for long-term exosome storage. Get a Quote More Details Description
Exosome refers to cup-shaped vesicles with a diameter ranging from 30 to 150
nm. These vesicles encapsulate various substances such as proteins, mRNA, and
microRNA. Exosomes can be secreted by various cells under normal and
pathological conditions and are present in various body fluids, including
blood, saliva, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and breast milk. The functions of
exosomes depend on the cell types they originate from and can be involved in
various aspects of the body's immune response, antigen presentation, cell
migration, cell differentiation, tumor invasion, and more. Under normal
circumstances, untreated exosomes maintained at 4°C can only preserve their
structural integrity for approximately 10 days. Although they can be stored
for an extended period at -80°C, this storage condition requires expensive
equipment, occupies substantial space, and is inconvenient for transportation.
Therefore, -80°C is not an ideal long-term storage condition for exosomes. We
have developed an exosome lyophilization protection agent. After vacuum
freeze-drying, the resulting exosome lyophilized powder can be stored for an
extended period at 4°C. Upon reconstitution, it retains the original exosome
morphology and biological activity, making it a highly practical method for
long-term exosome storage. Product Catalog Human Plasma Exosomes Human Serum

stored for at least 12 months at 2-8°C. Upon reconstitution, it is recommended
to use it within one week when stored at 2-8°C, one month at -20°C, or six
months at -80°C, to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Product Customization
We not only offer research-grade exosome purification and lyophilization
products and services, but also provide a variety of exosome extraction kits
and lyophilized protective solutions. Additionally, we have independently
developed a rapid and automated exosome purification instrument. For research
users, we can process various sample types, including cell culture
supernatants, urine, serum, or blood. You can choose extraction and
purification kits of different specifications based on sample type and volume.
After obtaining exosomes, you can perform BCA and NTA measurements. We also
offer additional assays upon request, such as transmission electron
microscopy, ELISA, nucleic acid extraction and detection (RT-qPCR or NGS), and
protein extraction and detection (Western Blot or mass spectrometry). For
industrial users, particularly those in the fields of regenerative medicine
and drug delivery research, we provide extraction services for large volumes
of various cell culture supernatants. Only for research and not intended for

details if required. Cat. No.: Cas9NG-500 (for 500pmol) Cat. No.: Cas9NG-1k
(for 1000pmol) Description SpCas9 nuclease originates from S. pyogenes. It is
an RNA-guided endonuclease that can catalyze the specific cleavage of double-
stranded DNA. It recognizes the NGG sequence of the PAM (Protospacer Adjacent
Motif) and cleaves at the 3rd base of the target sequence. The NGG of the PAM
sequence must be located after the gene editing target site, on the
complementary strand of the DNA strand complementary to the sgRNA. In order to
increase the PAM sequence promiscuity, the SpCas9 nuclease was modified to
obtain a mutant protein called SpCas9-NG. It can recognize PAM sequences
composed of NG, which greatly expands the range of selectable gene editing
sites. The SpCas9-NG nuclease produced by our company is a recombinant protein
expressed in E. coli and purified through multiple steps. The purity is over
90%. The N-terminus of the SpCas9-NG protein has a His tag and TEV protease
cleavage site, and no nuclear localization signal. Therefore, it cannot be
used for gene editing by transfecting or microinjecting cells. Our company
also has SpCas9-NG with nuclear localization signal (NLS) . Advantages
Compared with the mRNA or plasmid systems: Transcription and translation
processes are not required Avoiding the risk of inserting foreign DNA into the
genome Minimizing the off-target effect Applications In vitro DNA cleavage In
vitro DNA detection Storage Long-term storage should be at temperatures below
-20°C and the enzyme can be stored for up to 2 years. Avoiding repeated

CRISPR/Cas9 system is a technology of RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease which can edit
target genes. Combining Cas9 nuclease or genetically modified Cas9 nuclease
with genome-wide gRNA library can achieve genome-wide gene knockout or gene
transcription regulation, which can be used for various high-throughput
screening. Get a Quote More Details Description At SBS Genetech, we can
construct shRNA library and gRNA library according to customers' needs,
including whole-genome gene silencing, gene knockout, gene transcription
activation, and transcription inhibition. At the same time, we provide high-
throughput gene-editing services by using shRNA library or gRNA library and
screening services for drug target genes related to diseases by using high-
throughput gene-editing technology. Applications Forward screening: Screen
which gene mutations cause cell tolerance to different treatments. e.g. After
the Cas9-gRNA library is transfected into cells, treat the cells with the
target reagent (drugs, toxins, or pathogens). The surviving cells are
resistant to the reagent due to gene mutation. High-throughput sequencing is
used to analyze the changes of gRNA abundance before and after the treatment,
and the mutate genes can be identified. Negative screening: Screen which genes
are more sensitive to different treatments. e.g. After the Cas9-gRNA library
is transfected into cells, compare the abundance of gRNA in the cells with
different survival times. In the cells with a short survival time, the gene
mutation caused by Cas9-gRNA is probably related to cell proliferation.
Principle After predicting the target gene and designing the gRNA sequences,
synthesize the gRNA sequences by microarray. The lentiviral vector is used to
transfect all the gRNAs into the target cells (low MOI value). High-throughput
sequencing technology is used to detect the changes of gRNA abundance in cells
before and after treatment, and to infer the corresponding relationship
between gene function and cell phenotype. Related: Synthetic sgRNAs ,

Return to site Exploring Proteins in CRISPR Diagnosis: Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14
Unveiling the Intricacies of CRISPR Diagnosis and the Versatility of Cas12,
Cas13, and Cas14 Proteins January 20, 2024 · CRISPR In this era of rapid
technological advancement, CRISPR diagnosis has emerged as a captivating
application of biotechnology, drawing widespread attention. At the core of
CRISPR diagnosis is the utilization of specific protein families, including
Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14, forming complexes with proteins and guide molecules
to achieve recognition and cleavage of specific nucleic acid sequences. Basic
Principles of CRISPR Diagnosis The fundamental principle of CRISPR diagnosis
involves a process of non-specific cleavage. This technology comprises two key
components: the complex of proteins and guide molecules. These complexes first
cleave the specific nucleic acid sequences that users want to detect and then
proceed to cleave other non-specific nucleic acids. Modified nucleic acids,
also known as reporter genes, generate visual signals upon cleavage, making
them easily detectable only after the specific nucleic acids have been
cleaved. Introduction to Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14 Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14 are
crucial members of the protein family in CRISPR diagnosis, constituting the
protein part of the complex with proteins and guide molecules. These proteins
are derived from specific types of bacteria and archaea, yet they share some
key features. Cas12 Cas12 proteins directly bind and cleave user-specified DNA
sequences, capable of cleaving both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA.
After Cas12 proteins cleave their DNA targets, they non-specifically cleave
single-stranded DNA. Therefore, diagnostics based on Cas12 can only directly
detect DNA and must be combined with proteins that convert RNA to DNA for RNA
detection. Cas12 proteins are located on the larger side of CRISPR diagnostic
proteins, with a length of approximately 1,300 amino acids. Users employ 42-44
nt RNA molecules to specify Cas12 DNA targets. Cas12 dsDNA targets are
restricted as they must be located near short DNA fragments called protospacer
adjacent motifs (PAM). For some Cas12 proteins, the PAM sequence is TTTN.
Importantly, without PAM, diagnostics based on Cas12 cannot detect DNA
sequences. Cas12 proteins can easily distinguish very similar dsDNA sequences.
This functionality is lost when the target sequence is ssDNA. Cas13 Cas13
proteins directly bind and cleave user-specified RNA sequences, with a length
of approximately 1,400 amino acids. Similar to Cas12, Cas13 RNA guide
molecules are relatively short, around 64 nt. Cas13 proteins lack strong
targeting restrictions, but their RNA targets can adopt structures that are
challenging to cleave. Cas13 cleaves RNA sequences 1 nt away from specific
sequences, requiring careful testing when differentiating highly similar
sequences using Cas13-based diagnostics. Cas14 Cas14 proteins bind and cleave
specific single-stranded or double-stranded DNA. To detect RNA, diagnostics
based on Cas14 must be combined with proteins that can convert RNA to DNA.
Cas14 proteins have a smaller end, consisting of 400-700 amino acids. However,
their guide RNA is located on the longer side, approximately 140 nt. Cas14
proteins exhibit no targeting restrictions when cleaving ssDNA, making them
versatile. For dsDNA targeting, Cas14 proteins require a PAM sequence rich in
T, such as TTTA. Cas14 proteins can easily distinguish very similar ssDNA
sequences. Applications and Future Prospects of Protein Combinations Each
protein family has its advantages and disadvantages, but researchers have
demonstrated creative ways to combine proteins from multiple families in a
single detection. This combination can be used to simultaneously detect
multiple targets, opening up new possibilities for the widespread application
of CRISPR diagnostics. Scientists continue to discover and improve new CRISPR
systems, and it is believed that more innovative CRISPR diagnostic tools will
emerge in the future. These tools will find extensive applications in
healthcare, agriculture, food safety, infectious diseases, and other fields,
contributing to human health and societal development. At SBS Genetech , we
take pride in offering a comprehensive selection of Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14
proteins, empowering researchers and diagnostic professionals with cutting-
edge tools for CRISPR applications. Our diverse range of proteins is designed
to cater to various diagnostic needs, ensuring precision and efficiency in
nucleic acid sequence recognition and cleavage. Subscribe Previous Unraveling

Applications and Molecular Mechanisms of CRISPR/Cas Systems in Gene Editing,
Transcriptional Control, and Molecular Diagnostics January 10, 2024 · CRISPR
Since the introduction of the groundbreaking CRISPR/Cas technology, it has
received widespread acclaim and applause. In just a brief two or three years,
it has emerged as the most sought-after research tool in the field of life
sciences. So, what exactly is this CRISPR/Cas technology that researchers hold
in such high regard? The CRISPR/Cas system is an adaptive immune system
discovered in prokaryotes, comprising Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and associated proteins (Cas) – hence the name
CRISPR/Cas system. Let's delve into the various proteins within the CRISPR/Cas
system. Cas is the abbreviation for CRISPR-associated proteins. The CRISPR
system encompasses various common Cas proteins, ranging from Cas1 to Cas10, as
well as rarer types like Cas8a1, Cas12a, Cas13a, etc. The CRISPR/Cas system is
categorized into two major classes and five types based on the sequence
similarity between Cas genes and site structures: The first-class systems
(including types I, III, and IV) are found in bacteria and archaea, typically
forming multi-subunit protein–crRNA (CRISPR RNA) effector complexes. The
second-class systems (including types II, V, and VI) rely on a single crRNA-
guided protein for target interference, performed by a single multidomain
protein. In simpler terms, the classification of class I and class II
CRISPR/Cas systems depends on whether the structure of their effector
molecules is particularly simple. The effector molecules of class II
CRISPR/Cas systems, such as Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14, are standalone
proteins capable of independently cleaving DNA/RNA. Among all Cas proteins,
Cas1 constitutes 20.11%, Cas2 17.46%, Cas3, Cas5, Cas6, and Cas7 together
account for over 10%. The most renowned Cas9 protein makes up only 2.59% of
all Cas proteins. This article will focus on discussing Cas9, Cas12, Cas13,
and Cas14, which are effector proteins capable of independently cleaving
DNA/RNA. Cas Family Proteins: Cas1 and Cas2 proteins are core components in
the CRISPR system, participating in the integration of exogenous fragments in
the initial phase of the immune process. Cas3 possesses DNA cleavage and
helicase activities, serving as the core enzyme in type I CRISPR/Cas systems.
Cas4 is involved in the process of inserting exogenous DNA sequences into
bacterial DNA, primarily found in II-B and I-A/B/C/D type CRISPR/Cas systems.
Cas5 protein, along with other proteins, forms the Cascade complex to exert
functions. In E. coli (I-E type), the generated crRNA-Cas6 complex recruits 1
Cse protein, 2 Cse2 proteins, 6 Cse7 proteins, and 1 Cas5 protein. Cas6 is
responsible for processing pre-crRNA into mature crRNA. Cas7 and Cas8 are both
essential components of the Cascade complex. Cas10 is responsible for cleaving
DNA strands and serves as the core enzyme in type III CRISPR/Cas systems.
Cas10, together with multiple Csm/Cmr subunits and a crRNA (CRISPR RNA),
assembles into an effector complex. This complex can degrade both RNA and DNA
(ssDNA). Cas11 mainly participates in crRNA binding and is common in type III
CRISPR/Cas systems. In addition to the mentioned Cas proteins, Cas9, Cas12,
Cas13, and Cas14 are core single enzymes in class II systems, widely applied
in gene editing technologies. Let's delve into each one: Cas9 Protein: Cas9 is
a DNA endonuclease, and its cutting activity is guided by guide RNA molecules
containing sequences complementary to the target DNA, known as PAM sequences.
Cas9 precisely cleaves the target DNA three nucleotides upstream of the PAM,
forming blunt-ended products. The HNH domain of Cas9 is responsible for
cutting the DNA strand complementary to crRNA, while the RuvC domain cuts the
non-complementary strand. Ultimately, under the action of Cas9, double-strand
DNA breaks (DSB) occur, and the cell utilizes homologous recombination or non-
homologous end joining to repair the broken DNA, achieving knockout or knock-
in of DNA fragments. Cas9 Applications: Cas9 has two cutting-active domains:
HNH and RuvC. The HNH domain cuts the DNA strand complementary to crRNA, while
the RuvC domain cuts the non-complementary strand. By mutating only the RuvC I
domain of Cas9, specifically converting one of the two key amino acid residues
in RuvC I to alanine (D10A or H840A), a Cas9 nickase (Cas9n) is obtained. This
nickase cannot cut the non-complementary DNA strand but can cut the DNA strand
complementary to crRNA, significantly reducing off-target effects while
maintaining efficient gene modification. By point mutations that inactivate
both active domains, RuvC- and HNH-, where the aspartic acid at position 10 of
the RuvC catalytic domain is mutated to alanine (D10A), and the histidine at
position 840 of the HNH catalytic domain is mutated to alanine (H840A), a Cas9
protein loses its endonuclease activity, forming dCas9. dCas9 can bind to the
target gene under the guidance of sgRNA but lacks the ability to cut DNA.
Therefore, binding dCas9 to the transcription start site of a gene can block
the initiation of transcription, inhibiting gene expression. Binding dCas9 to
the promoter region of a gene can also recruit transcriptional
repression/activation factors, suppressing or activating downstream target
gene transcription. The difference between dCas9 and Cas9 or Cas9n is that the
activation or inhibition caused by dCas9 is reversible and does not result in
permanent changes to the genomic DNA. Cas12 Protein: CRISPR–Cas12a protein,
formerly known as Cpf1, is an endonuclease that can be programmed by guide RNA
to target complementary DNA sequences. Upon binding to the target DNA,
CRISPR–Cas12a protein induces cleavage on each target DNA strand, resulting in
double-strand DNA breaks. In addition to inducing cis cleavage of the target
DNA, target DNA binding also induces trans cleavage of non-target DNA.
Therefore, the CRISPR–Cas12a-RNA guide complex can provide sequence-specific
immunity against invasive nucleic acids such as phages and plasmids. Similar
to CRISPR/Cas9, Cas12a has been repurposed as a genetic tool for programmable
genome editing and transcriptional control in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic
cells. Furthermore, its trans cleavage activity has been applied to highly
sensitive nucleic acid detection. The off-target rate of the CRISPR/Cas12a
system is much lower than that of Cas9, and because of its differences from
Cas9, it can complement with Cas9, expanding the toolbox of CRISPR/Cas
systems, making gene editing technologies based on CRISPR/Cas systems more
versatile and powerful. Cas12b is an RNA-guided endonuclease that, in the
presence of a PAM on the target DNA, can specifically cleave the target
double-stranded DNA. Cas12b is smaller than Cas9 and Cas12a, and it has higher
cleavage activity, originating from the acidothermophilic bacterium
Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris. Cas12b's optimal cleavage reaction
temperature is 48 ℃. Similar to Cas12a, Cas12b recognizes the PAM sequence
5'-TTN, and it produces sticky ends after cutting the DNA. However, Cas12b is
double RNA-guided, depending on both crRNA and tracrRNA (or sgRNA formed after
connection). Additionally, Cas12b can be used not only for cutting target
dsDNA but also for rapid detection of target nucleic acids, as seen in the
HOLMESv2 nucleic acid rapid detection technology. Cas13 Protein: Cas13
proteins can be further divided into four subtypes: CRISPR-Cas13a, b, c, and
d. While research on Cas13c is currently not sufficient, the other three Cas
proteins have been widely researched and applied. Cas13a is an RNA-guided RNA
endonuclease. In the presence of a PFS sequence on the target single-stranded
RNA, it can specifically cleave the target RNA. Additionally, Cas13a has
reverse cutting activity dependent on the target single-stranded RNA, used for
developing rapid detection assays for target nucleic acids. For example,
researchers at MIT, led by Feng Zhang, have developed a next-generation
molecular diagnostic system called "SHERLOCK" using Cas13a protein. For
bacteria, Cas13a's reverse cutting activity is meaningful. If bacteria are
infected by phages, it can activate programmed cell death or dormancy to limit
the spread of infection throughout the population. Similar to Cas13a, Cas13b
requires only a single guide RNA to target specific sequences. Moreover,
Cas13b can simultaneously target multiple RNA transcripts. The later-
discovered Cas13d has higher efficiency, lower off-target rates, and,
importantly, a smaller size compared to other Cas13 family members. Cas13d is
more easily packaged into viral vectors, providing better delivery advantages
and application prospects. Cas14 Protein: In addition to the aforementioned
Cas proteins with target cleavage capabilities, the recently discovered Cas14
also possesses similar functions. Cas14a is an RNA-guided endonuclease, which,
under the guidance of tracrRNA:crRNA (or sgRNA), specifically binds and
cleaves the target ssDNA without the need for a PAM site. Cas14 proteins
generally have smaller molecular weights (400-700 aa) compared to other Cas
proteins. Similar to Cas12, Cas14a can also bind to target nucleic acids and
activate its ssDNA reverse cutting activity. Researchers believe that Cas14's
cutting target is single-stranded DNA, not double-stranded DNA, so it might
not be an ideal genome editing tool. However, they consider Cas14 useful in
the DETECTR diagnostic tool. As SBS Genetech , we take pride in providing

Return to site LAMP-CRISPR Technology: A Game-Changer in Point-of-Care
Pathogen Detection Discover the Breakthrough Integration of LAMP and CRISPR
for Accurate and Rapid Point-of-Care Testing of Infectious Diseases May 16,
2023 · Isothermal Amp, CRISPR The primary objective of effectively managing
infectious diseases and epidemics is the prompt and accurate detection of
pathogens, with COVID-19 serving as a prime example. The significance and
demand for point-of-care (POC) testing have been particularly emphasized
during the ongoing pandemic. According to the World Health Organization, POC
testing should adhere to the ASSURED criteria, encompassing affordability,
sensitivity, specificity, user-friendliness, robustness, equipment-free
operation, and deliverability. Developing pathogen-specific POC tests that
fulfill all of these criteria poses a considerable challenge. Consequently, in
vitro diagnostic companies have been focusing their efforts on combining
existing technologies in recent years. Among the most revolutionary and
promising approaches is the integration of isothermal amplification with
CRISPR technology, which not only meets the ASSURED criteria but also
represents an ideal method for the development of a new generation of POC
diagnostics. This article will primarily provide a comprehensive overview of
the CRISPR technology based on LAMP and explore the following key aspects:
LAMP and CRISPR technology Rationale behind selecting the combination of LAMP
and CRISPR technology Application of LAMP-CRISPR technology in POC platforms
01 - LAMP (Loop-mediated isothermal amplification) LAMP, or loop-mediated
isothermal amplification, is a groundbreaking gene amplification method
invented by Dr. Masahiro Notomi of Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. in Japan in 2000.
This technique has gained significant attention due to its simplicity, speed,
accuracy, and cost-effectiveness in detecting pathogens across human, animal,
and agricultural samples. During the COVID-19 pandemic, LAMP technology has
experienced remarkable advancements with various improved methods used for
detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, marking a golden age for LAMP. The
distinguishing feature of LAMP lies in its utilization of 4-6 primers that
selectively target specific regions of DNA. The amplification process is
initiated by the Bst enzyme, possessing strand-displacement activity, and two
specially designed primers. This leads to the formation of loop structures,
resulting in the exponential production of DNA after successive amplification
cycles. Remarkably, LAMP can amplify 1-10 DNA copies into an abundant 10^9 -
10^10 copies within a timeframe of 15-60 minutes, showcasing its exceptional
sensitivity and specificity. One of the key advantages of LAMP is its
simplicity, as it does not necessitate temperature cycling like qPCR. The
amplification reaction is carried out at a constant temperature of 60-65°C,
and the results can be observed using various methods such as turbidity,
fluorescence, or probe-based techniques. This user-friendly approach enhances
the practicality and versatility of LAMP in diverse diagnostic applications.
02 - CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)
CRISPR, also known as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic
Repeats, is an RNA-based adaptive immune defense system. It utilizes spacer
sequences that exhibit similarity to viral or plasmid sequences, allowing it
to employ target-specific RNA to guide Cas proteins in the precise recognition
and correction of genetic errors in a wide range of organisms and cells. The
CRISPR/Cas system consists of a guide RNA (gRNA) sequence that serves as a
navigational tool for Cas proteins (CRISPR-associated nucleases) to target
specific regions within foreign genomic material: The gRNA, comprising
tracrRNA and crRNA regions, can be specifically designed to target desired
regions, affording the CRISPR/Cas system its programmability. Cas proteins,
acting in accordance with the gRNA, act as nucleases capable of recognizing
and cleaving target sequences in DNA or RNA. The CRISPR/Cas system represents
a remarkable and highly promising technology, applicable to gene editing and
molecular diagnostics. Through its programmable gRNA sequence, it allows for
precise targeting of any gene region. In the field of infectious disease
detection, its primary role lies in pathogen identification and nucleic acid-
based diagnostics facilitated by Cas proteins. Cas proteins are classified
into two main classes: Cas9, possessing target cleavage activity, and Cas12,
Cas13, and Cas14, exhibiting collateral cleavage activity upon target
recognition. Cas12 and Cas13 are commonly employed, with Cas12 cleaving non-
target single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and Cas13 cleaving single-stranded RNA
(ssRNA). CRISPR/Cas technology has revolutionized nucleic acid detection by
combining it with pre-amplification or post-amplification steps. This synergy
with PCR or isothermal amplification methods like LAMP, RPA, NASBA, and RCA
has ushered in a new era of molecular diagnostics, enabling highly sensitive
and specific detection of DNA and RNA. Notable examples include: CRISPR/Cas9
combined with NASBA technology, successfully applied for Zika virus detection
and lineage identification. CRISPR-Cas9 typing PCR (ctPCR), a pre-
amplification process for detecting HPV subtypes. The SHERLOCK system, gaining
popularity, which merges Cas13 with RPA in CRISPR/Cas technology, facilitating
molecular diagnostics of viruses like dengue fever and Zika virus. Cas14
enzyme combined with RCA, enabling detection of microRNA (miRNA) and single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). HOLMES, a fusion of CRISPR/Cas with PCR.
Cas12 combined with LAMP and RPA methods for pathogen-specific detection.
Initially known as the DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter
(DETECTR) method, this combined technique has gained traction in point-of-care
(POC) diagnostics. The application and development of DETECTR have led to an
increasing adoption of LAMP-based CRISPR/Cas technologies in pathogen
research. These combined approaches exemplify the versatility and immense
potential of CRISPR/Cas technology in advancing molecular diagnostics for
accurate pathogen detection. 03 - LAMP-CRISPR (Loop-mediated isothermal
amplification combined with CRISPR) LAMP-CRISPR represents a cutting-edge
molecular diagnostic technology that has emerged in recent years for pathogen
detection. This innovative approach combines the strengths of both techniques,
effectively overcoming their individual limitations. LAMP, known for its rapid
amplification capabilities, can be susceptible to false-positive results.
Factors such as incorrect primer design, DNA contamination, and suboptimal
reaction conditions (such as buffer pH, Mg concentration, or interfering dyes)
can compromise the assay's specificity and sensitivity. CRISPR/Cas technology,
on the other hand, leverages a reporter system to detect specific targets,
offering a powerful solution to mitigate the limitations of LAMP and minimize
the occurrence of false-positive results. This integration results in a highly
sensitive and specific diagnostic platform. By combining LAMP with CRISPR/Cas
technology, visualizing the results becomes feasible through fluorescence
chromatographic strips or direct visual inspection. This eliminates the need
for quantitative measurements typically required in other nucleic acid
detection methods. Consequently, this streamlined approach enables efficient,
sensitive, specific, and user-friendly point-of-care (POC) testing without the
requirement for complex equipment. In the combination of CRISPR/Cas with LAMP
technology, Cas12 endonucleases are particularly favored due to their
collateral cleavage activity. Cas12 enzymes encompass several subtypes,
including Cas12a, Cas12c, Cas12d, Cas12e, Cas12b, Cas12h, Cas12i, and Cas12g.
Among these subtypes, Cas12a and Cas12b are the most commonly employed in
LAMP-CRISPR detection, with Cas12a being the preferred choice. This preference
stems from the fact that Cas12b requires a lengthy single-guide RNA (sgRNA) of
111 nucleotides, which encompasses the crRNA and tracrRNA regions. The
extended sgRNA may potentially overlap with the LAMP primers designed to
target the specific region, leading to false-positive results. In contrast,
Cas12a utilizes a shorter gRNA of 41 nucleotides, which was originally
employed in the development of the DETECTR method. Cas13 has also found
utility in LAMP-CRISPR applications. As Cas13 cleaves single-stranded RNA
(ssRNA), an additional T7 transcription step is necessary when utilizing
Cas13. This step allows for the conversion of the pre-amplified DNA products
into RNA molecules. LAMP-CRISPR/Cas technology has been extensively utilized
for detecting a wide range of infectious viruses and bacteria. Remarkably,
this approach has exhibited exceptional specificity and sensitivity, reaching
up to 100% in pathogen detection assays. Moreover, LAMP-CRISPR outperforms the
gold standard qPCR by significantly reducing turnaround times, rendering it
highly suitable for rapid testing applications. However, it is important to
acknowledge that LAMP-CRISPR/Cas also has certain limitations, primarily due
to the requirement of two separate steps: the amplification process and the
CRISPR/Cas process. These steps involve different chemical components and
reaction conditions. LAMP amplification utilizes the Bst enzyme at
temperatures around 60-65 degrees Celsius, while the CRISPR reaction with Cas
enzymes typically occurs at approximately 37 degrees Celsius. This
necessitates the use of two different temperatures, which can potentially
increase the risk of contamination. Fortunately, there are strategies
available to overcome this limitation. For example, in HOLMESv2 detection, a
solution is found by utilizing a thermostable Cas12b enzyme derived from
Acidophilic Bacillus, enabling a single-tube reaction and eliminating the need
for different reaction temperatures. Another approach to minimize technical
demands and contamination risks for the operator involves sealing the LAMP
reagents at the bottom of the reaction tube with oil and covering the CRISPR
reagents with a reaction tube cap, facilitating a single-tube reaction. After
LAMP amplification, the tube is inverted to mix the contents and initiate the
CRISPR/Cas12a process. CRISPR/Cas technology can also be combined with PCR and
other isothermal methods, such as NASBA, RCA, and RPA. However, each of these
approaches has its limitations. PCR, for instance, is not ideal for point-of-
care (POC) diagnostic platforms due to the need for complex thermal cycling
equipment. Similarly to LAMP, other isothermal amplification methods do not
require complex equipment. However, they typically involve the use of two
primers and two or more enzymes. NASBA, for example, relies on three enzymes
for amplifying RNA or single-stranded DNA. Furthermore, the combination of
CRISPR and NASBA generally exhibits lower sensitivity compared to other
methods. In contrast, LAMP technology offers advantages in terms of lower
costs and operational complexity by utilizing a single Bst enzyme. Moreover,
LAMP provides higher specificity and efficiency by utilizing multiple primers.
RPA is widely used as well but requires an additional step to convert the
amplification products into RNA molecules. As a result, it is often combined
with the Cas13 enzyme. One of RPA's main advantages is its reaction
temperature, which closely matches that of the CRISPR reaction. However, it
has a major limitation in the lower concentration of amplification products
compared to CRISPR, leading to decreased sensitivity when the target
concentration is low. When combined with CRISPR, LAMP can generate high
concentrations of amplification products. Therefore, LAMP is preferred over
other isothermal methods for integration with CRISPR technology in POC
diagnostic platforms. 04 - LAMP-CRISPR in POC Applications Inspired by LAMP
technology's success in point-of-care (POC) platforms, LAMP-CRISPR POC devices
streamline the process into three stages: DNA/RNA extraction, LAMP
amplification, and CRISPR/Cas reaction. By integrating these steps into a
single tube, user convenience is maximized. Various POC platforms have
successfully implemented this approach. The key concept involves integrating
LAMP and CRISPR/Cas reactions on a microfluidic chip and using fluorescence
detection or lateral flow chromatography for result analysis. For instance, a
portable POC instrument is designed as a compact, rechargeable, and semi-
automated device measuring only 3.5cm x 3cm x 13cm. It finds applications in
mobile laboratories, airports, and quarantine areas. The instrument includes a
temperature-adjusting button to facilitate RT-LAMP amplification at 65°C and
CRISPR/Cas12a reaction at 37°C. Within a rapid 35-minute timeframe, it can
detect up to 10 samples, with results visually interpreted using
chromatographic paper. 05 - Solution of SBS Genetech SBS Genetech is proud to

amplification at lower temperatures. Elevated reaction temperature: By raising
the reaction temperature to 70°C, the formation of primer dimers is

Return to site Enhancing Freeze-Drying for Molecular Diagnostics: Principles
and Challenges Learn essential principles for developing protective agents and
discover how SBS Genetech's range of lyophilized enzyme materials can advance
your research in PCR, LAMP, RPA, CRISPR, and beyond. July 4, 2024 · Freeze-
drying Freeze-drying, also known as lyophilization, is a process where
materials are sublimated under frozen conditions. Throughout this process, the
materials undergo stages of low temperature, freezing, and vacuum sublimation.
Initially, water in the solution crystallizes into ice, while the remaining
water and solutes gradually form a highly concentrated liquid, ultimately
freezing together. These changes impose various stresses on enzymes within the
system. Firstly, there's the stress of low temperatures. Additionally, the
formation of the highly concentrated liquid can lead to changes in ion
strength and pH, further pressurizing the enzymes. Finally, dehydration also
poses a stress, potentially causing protein precipitation or inactivation.
Hence, to maintain the activity of biomacromolecules during freeze-drying,
it's essential to add various protective agents to overcome these stresses.
Although many studies have summarized this from different angles, such as the
role of protective agents and types of compounds, applying these principles to
molecular diagnostics presents its own challenges. On one hand, the freeze-
drying process for molecular diagnostics demands higher standards. It relies
on enzyme activity for amplification and subsequent detection, requiring not
only intact protein sequences but also preserved spatial structures. On the
other hand, molecular diagnostics itself adheres to specific rules. Directly
applying the principles of drug freeze-drying to molecular diagnostics may
lead to complications. For instance, various amino acids commonly used in drug
freeze-drying often interfere with molecular diagnostics. Therefore, freeze-
drying for molecular diagnostics has its own set of principles. Combining
molecular diagnostics, we can briefly elucidate the principles of freeze-
drying agent development. Principle One: Utilize molecular biology-grade
materials This is an often-overlooked issue. We are accustomed to using
reagents (suppliers) that have been screened for "molecular biology-grade"
during routine development. However, in the development of freeze-drying
protective agents, the quality standards of reagents are crucial. If certain
reagents do not meet the requirements, it may affect the performance of
freeze-dried reagents. Therefore, ensuring the quality of raw materials is
crucial. Principle Two: Prioritize the freeze-drying process Consideration of
the freeze-drying process is crucial. Firstly, pay attention to the change in
volume after freeze-drying. Some customers only discover that the volume after
freeze-drying exceeds expectations after determining the system and plate,
leading to subsequent issues. Additionally, pay attention to the preservation
of enzyme activity. Although in most cases there is no significant difference
in enzyme activity before and after freeze-drying, in reality, it is
challenging to completely preserve enzyme activity. Therefore, it is necessary
to prioritize the effects of freeze-drying during development to fully
leverage the advantages of freeze-dried reagents. Principle Three: Avoid using
volatile reagents During the freeze-drying process, it is advisable to avoid
using volatile reagents such as DMSO, TMAC, and formamide. These reagents may
evaporate during the sublimation process, affecting the freeze-drying results.
It is more ideal to choose formulas without glycerol or with extremely low
concentrations of glycerol. In summary, the development of freeze-drying
protective agents requires consideration of various factors, especially in the
field of molecular diagnostics. By adhering to the above principles, the
performance and stability of freeze-dried reagents can be effectively
improved, thus better applied in experiments and diagnostics. At SBS Genetech
, we offer a range of freeze-dried enzyme raw materials and finished
microbeads covering PCR, LAMP, RPA, CRISPR, and other systems, bringing more
progress to researchers. Subscribe Previous Advanced Freeze-Drying Techniques

Manufacturing Boosting Efficiency and Quality in Bioproduction through
Optimized Freeze-Drying Processes November 13, 2023 · Freeze-drying In the
process of preparing bioproducts, freeze-drying technology is a crucial step,
and its success directly correlates with the quality and stability of the
final product. This article will delve into several key factors influencing
the effectiveness of freeze-drying and propose optimization recommendations to
achieve more efficient production. Increase Pre-freeze Cooling Rate The rate
of pre-freeze cooling in the freeze-drying process is a critical factor
influencing its effectiveness. The freezing process is characterized by two
parameters: degree of supercooling and ice crystallization rate. The higher
the degree of supercooling, the smaller the ice crystal size, leading to
increased sublimation resistance. Therefore, we recommend adopting a rapid
freezing rate to minimize ice crystal size, thus reducing sublimation
resistance. Additionally, a fast ice crystal growth rate helps minimize the
time the product stays in a frozen concentrated state, reducing the risk of
loss of activity. Freeze-Drying Formulation Design When designing freeze-
drying formulations, several factors need to be considered, including
cryoprotectants, heat-stable additives, active protectants, and buffers.
Ensure that each component in the formulation plays a role during the freeze-
drying process, providing mechanical strength, heat stability, and pH
stability. Focus on parameters such as eutectic points, collapse temperature,
and glass transition temperature of the sample, conducting preliminary
research analysis through freeze-drying microscopy or DSC. Optimize
Reconstitution Rate Various factors, including freeze-drying formulations and
freeze-drying process, complicate the factors influencing the reconstitution
rate of freeze-dried powder. Solid content, local collapse, and the specific
surface area of the freeze-dried cake are important influencing factors. The
use of eutectic substances can increase the specific surface area, thereby
improving the reconstitution efficiency to some extent. Considering these
factors and developing a reasonable freeze-drying process can help improve the
reconstitution rate of the product. Annealing for Increased Uniformity
Introducing an annealing step during the freeze-drying process can enhance the
uniformity of the product before sublimation drying. While annealing is not
always necessary under normal circumstances, it can be considered when
uniformity issues arise. Annealing involves raising the temperature of the
frozen sample to below the eutectic temperature, holding it for a period, and
then lowering the temperature back to the freezing temperature. Study of
Residual Moisture Studying the moisture content of freeze-dried products is a
crucial step in ensuring the final product's quality. Traditional methods for
residual moisture detection include Karl Fischer (KF) titration and
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). These methods can measure the total moisture
content in freeze-dried products. After freeze-drying, residual moisture may
exist in various forms, so it is necessary to consider different detection
methods to comprehensively understand the moisture status of the product. By

Return to site Revolutionizing Molecular Diagnostics: Unveiling the Power of
Lyophilization with SBS Genetech In-depth Insights into Lyophilization
Techniques, From In Situ to Innovative Lyophilized Beads, Redefining the
Future of Molecular Diagnostics · Freeze-drying Lyophilization, also known as
freeze drying, is not a new topic in the field of biology. As early as 1890,
Richard Altmann first conducted lyophilization of biological organs. With the
development of vacuum equipment, lyophilization technology has been widely
applied in modern pharmaceuticals and bioproducts, such as blood products,
vaccines, antibiotics, and various applications in the food industry. With the
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for lyophilization in the in
vitro diagnostics (IVD) field has been increasing. In addition to meeting the
basic requirements of point-of-care testing (POCT), lyophilized products in
the IVD field have several advantages: Cost Reduction: Lyophilization can
reduce costs on multiple levels. Well-processed lyophilized products can be
stored at room temperature for an extended period, reducing the need for cold
storage construction costs, corresponding compliance monitoring costs, and the
energy consumption costs of the cold storage itself. Additionally,
lyophilization can lower the logistics costs of cold chain transportation,
including requirements for cold chain packaging, carbon emission regulations,
and material degradation costs. Convenience of Use: Adopting the form of
quantitative lyophilization allows end-users to avoid traditional steps such
as thawing and reconstitution of reagents, providing convenience, time
savings, and reduced operational errors for customers. Well-processed
lyophilized products can achieve rapid reconstitution, enabling instant use.
Extended Shelf Life: According to literature reports, lyophilized products
with good processes can have a shelf life of up to twenty years. In general,
well-formulated and well-processed molecular diagnostic reagents can be stored
at room temperature for more than two years, meeting the stringent expiration
date requirements of end-users. Regarding the choice between in situ
lyophilization and lyophilized beads: Lyophilization itself is a process
issue, and there are many paths from the beginning to the end of
lyophilization. The exploration of lyophilization processes (good processes)
is not only about ensuring the consistency and stability of product quality
but also about minimizing the lyophilization process and energy consumption.
Lyophilization processes are related not only to lyophilization equipment,
environment, lyophilized products themselves, and formulation of protective
agents but also to the form of lyophilization. In the IVD field, the most
common forms of lyophilization are in situ lyophilization and lyophilized
beads. In situ lyophilization involves placing the liquid directly in the
packaging container for lyophilization, also known as in-place lyophilization.
It is a very mature lyophilization system with a history of over a hundred
years in the lyophilization field. Because lyophilization occurs within the
container, there are high requirements for the container. For example, in the
pharmaceutical industry, the widely used vials, such as vials for penicillin,
have different manufacturing processes—molded vials and tubing vials. However,
tubing vials are mainly used for lyophilization. Compared to molded vials,
tubing vials have better contact with the bottom and uniform wall thickness.
Uniform wall thickness ensures stable and uniform heat exchange during
lyophilization, which is crucial for ensuring lyophilization stability and
reliability. In the early stages of the IVD field, many immunoassay,
biochemical, and coagulation reagents were also lyophilized using vials. Its
characteristic is multi-dose lyophilization, reconstitution before use,
effectively solving the problem of cold chain transportation. As globalization
has accelerated the demand for molecular diagnostic reagents among different
countries worldwide, the associated transportation costs and environmental
pressures have also placed significant demands on lyophilization. The demand
for lyophilization in the molecular diagnostic field is particularly urgent,
and in situ lyophilization is the most easily thought of solution, with
satisfactory results currently. However, in situ lyophilization cannot escape
the requirements for flat-bottom bottles. As a result, people have attempted
in situ lyophilization directly using PCR tubes. In this process, there are
various issues related to process control, batch-to-batch variation, inter-
batch variation, large gaps, and limited production capacity. Why lyophilized
beads? Looking globally, lyophilized beads are a prominent method in the
lyophilization of molecular diagnostics. Essentially, it solves several
problems: Individual Packaging: Achieves individual packaging for single-dose
use. Distribution after Lyophilization: Allows for redistribution after
lyophilization. Mass Production Capability: Solves the issue of mass
production capacity. However, the lyophilization of beads has changed the
original form of liquid distribution and mass production for IVD. Currently,
there is no particularly professional equipment and skilled operators for
matching, which has become a bottleneck limiting the industry's development.
For lyophilized bead production, the process can be roughly divided into the
following stages: Formula Optimization: Optimizing the formula involves
creating stable and well-shaped beads, considering the requirements for
moisture desorption during lyophilization, and determining the impact of
additives on signal enhancement or attenuation in subsequent experiments.
Commonly used sugars, mannitol, etc., all play a role, but whether they can be
used in a specific formula and the required concentration are crucial for the
entire diagnostic system and require exploration. Bead Production Process: The
bead production process requires precise control of droplet dosing and
continuous production. Currently, some domestic companies are attempting to
develop similar equipment, but there is a gap in the understanding of the
inspection industry by equipment manufacturers. For practitioners in the
biological field, understanding the use and control logic of fluid-related
equipment requires a high level of knowledge, and precision fluid control
equipment often needs adjustment to adapt to different viscosities,
formulations, and surfactants. Exploration of Drying Curves: The exploration
of drying curves is an operation that combines experience and practice
throughout the process. There are many mature lyophilizers on the market that
can serve as reference equipment, but to develop equipment that meets or
adapts to small beads, the basic framework structure must be understood in the
entire process. When necessary, equipment may need to be modified to improve
production capacity, energy consumption, and equipment applicability. Low-
temperature drying is the best for preserving the activity of the material
compared to other drying methods. In the entire equipment, considerations must
be given to the shape and arrangement of the drying vacuum chamber, as well as
the location, size, and water absorption of the desiccant chamber. Common
lyophilizers use a low-temperature cold trap to capture moisture in the
material, which places high demands on moisture capture. The drying process is
divided into primary drying (MD) and secondary drying (SD), and the conditions
for primary drying must match the shape of our formulated liquid. For example,
before designing a program, it is necessary to measure eutectic points,
melting points, etc. Generally, the drying temperature of the main formulation
is kept lower than the eutectic point to effectively control and improve the
collapse and surface pitting of beads during the drying process. After MD,
there is often some bound water in the bead product that could not be frozen
earlier, and it is dried again during the SD process. However, in many tests,
it has been found that there is a certain predetermined value for the drying
of SD. If this predetermined value is exceeded, it may cause damage to the
activity of the product. Experience and necessary means help find the best
drying curve. Control of Filling Humidity: After drying, the product has a low
water content. Taking molecular diagnostics as an example, it can generally
maintain long-term stability, with a water content of around 3%. This places
high demands on the control of filling humidity. To ensure the stability of
the entire process, the environmental humidity during filling generally needs
to be controlled below 5%. This places very high demands on the factory's
environment and energy consumption. Different means of humidity control place
high demands on the rate of dehumidification, final humidity retention, energy
consumption, and cost control. The filling speed also affects the stability of
the operation. Therefore, automated equipment and related tools become
particularly important, but different consumables and bead sizes and
characteristics need to be considered during the design of the equipment. For
bead production, quality control after mass production is critical. For well-
explored processes and parameters, after producing well-shaped beads, it is
necessary to conduct random testing of the water content and functionality of
the beads. It may be necessary to retain samples for aging and accelerated
testing. For water content testing, mature methods include weight analysis,
Karl Fischer titration, thermogravimetric analysis, and infrared spectroscopy.

stability and suitability of our process and the final long-term storage. In

Effective and Stable Protein Shipping Solutions Explore Revolutionary
Molecular Modifications and Lyophilization Technologies for Robust and
Affordable International Protein Transportation July 4, 2023 · Freeze-drying
Transportation often comprises a substantial cost for the production and sales
of many high-added-value proteins. Particularly in international
transportation, where dry ice is required to maintain the stability of protein
samples, the freight costs can be extraordinarily high, at times even
surpassing the price of the products themselves. This undeniably exerts
substantial economic pressure on customers. SBS Genetech , a proactive biotech
company, has mitigated this issue through two methods. Enhancing Thermal
Stability: Molecular-level Modification Through innovative technology at the
molecular level, SBS Genetech has improved the thermal stability of proteins.
For instance, our T4 UvsX Recombinease , after modification, has shown no
significant activity change at 40 degrees for a month. This means we can
replace expensive dry ice shipping with regular ice pack shipping, with almost
no change in the production cost of the product. This not only reduces
shipping costs but also minimizes environmental impact. Application of
Lyophilization Technology: Lowering Transportation Requirements The second
method involves introducing advanced lyophilization technology. Several
proteins, such as our Cas protein series (e.g. Cas13a Nuclease , Cas12a
Nuclease ), can now be offered in the form of lyophilized powder. This means
these proteins can be transported at room temperature, circumventing the hefty
dry ice transportation fees. Although the lyophilization process slightly
elevates the product price, the significant reduction in overall
transportation costs still notably decreases the comprehensive cost of the
product. Currently, at SBS Genetech, approximately 25% of protein products
exhibit high thermal stability, and about 35% of protein products can be
provided in lyophilized form. Customers can identify the form by checking
whether the top left corner of the product icon is marked with "Lyophilized"
or "Lyophilized ver. avl." (meaning lyophilized version available). Our

Therapy (IF: 13)! A novel mRNA-based therapeutic HPV vaccine, mHTV-03E2,
demonstrates promising efficacy in targeting high-risk HPV-associated
malignancies, offering a potential breakthrough in cancer treatment. May 11,
2024 · News, Publications On May 5, 2024, a team of researchers including Jing
Wang, Ling Ma, Kai Lv, Rui Zhou, Dongrong Yi, Qian Liu, Yongxin Zhang, Xiaoyu
Li, Tingting Cheng, and Shan Cen from the Institute of Medicinal
Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, collaborated with
scientists from RinuaGene Biotechnology Co., Ltd., including Qixin Wang, Yi
Wang, Tingting Zhang, Jinming Zhang, Chunjian Huang, Yijie Dong, and Weiguo
Zhang, published a research paper titled "Development of an mRNA-based
therapeutic vaccine mHTV-03E2 for high-risk HPV related malignancies" in
Molecular Therapy (impact factor: 12.91). In this study, the research team
have successfully developed a novel mRNA-based therapeutic HPV vaccine, named
mHTV-03E2, targeting high-risk HPV-associated malignancies. Human
Papillomavirus (HPV) infections, particularly HPV 16 and 18, are implicated in
numerous human cancers. Despite the availability of preventive vaccines for
high-risk HPV strains, there remains an urgent need for therapeutic HPV
vaccines to address existing high-risk HPV infections and lesions. Utilizing
lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology for efficient mRNA delivery, the team
developed the mHTV-03E2 vaccine targeting the E2/E6/E7 proteins of both HPV16
and HPV18. The vaccine significantly induced antigen-specific cellular immune
responses, leading to notable infiltration of CD8+ T cells and enhanced
cytotoxicity within tumors. This resulted in remarkable tumor regression and
prolonged animal survival in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, sustained T
cell immunity against HPV16/18 E6/E7 antigens was observed for up to 4 months
post-vaccination, indicating the vaccine's potential for preventing tumor
relapse. Additionally, when combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy,
mHTV-03E2 showed synergistic effects in inhibiting tumor growth and extending
animal survival, suggesting promising prospects for combination therapy. In
conjunction with the research study, a set of peptides spanning the HPV16/18
E2, E6 and E7 antigens, each containing 15 amino acid residues overlapping by
eight amino acids, were synthesized from SBS Genetech. Since 2000, SBS

ADVANCES (IF: 15)! This study reveals the suppressive role of FoxA1 in liver
cancer and identifies IKBKE as a key regulator, offering a promising strategy
for targeted therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma. February 10, 2024 ·
Publications, News Physiologically, FoxA1 plays a key role in liver
differentiation and development, and pathologically exhibits an oncogenic role
in prostate and breast cancers. However, its role and upstream regulation in
liver tumorigenesis remain unclear. On February 7, 2024, Jianping Guo, Lixia
Xu, Wei Xie from Sun Yat-sen University, and Ying Liang from Guangzhou Medical
University, co-corresponding authors, published a research paper titled
"Atypical inflammatory kinase IKBKE phosphorylates and inactivates FoxA1 to
promote liver tumorigenesis" online in Science Advances (impact factor:
14.98). This study demonstrated the suppressive role of FoxA1 in liver cancer.
Using a CRISPR-based kinome screening approach, they found that the
noncanonical inflammatory kinase IKBKE can inhibit FoxA1's transcriptional
activity. It is noteworthy that IKBKE directly binds to and phosphorylates
FoxA1, reducing its complex formation and DNA interaction, resulting in an
increase in hepatocellular malignancies. Knock-in mice with non-phosphorylated
mimic Foxa1 significantly delayed liver tumor occurrence in hydrodynamic
transfection murine models, while knock-in mice with phospho-mimic Foxa1
phenocopied Foxa1 knockout mice, exhibiting developmental defects and liver
inflammation. Importantly, Ikbke knockout delayed the development of
diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver tumors in mice. In summary, this study
not only reveals FoxA1 as a bona fide substrate and negative nuclear effector
of IKBKE in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but also provides a promising
strategy to target IKBKE for HCC therapy. DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adk2285 In

Communications (IF: 18)! The study unveils a critical insight into the
mechanics of tumor progression, especially concerning the PI3K/AKT signaling
pathway. It specifically emphasizes the role of NLRP6 in enhancing
tumorigenesis by promoting the autophagic degradation of p85α. October 1, 2023
· News, Publications On September 28th, a breakthrough paper was published by
researchers from Sun Yat-sen University and Soochow University in the
prominent journal Nature Communications (impactful factor: 17.694). The
research, entitled “ NLRP6 Potentiates PI3K/AKT Signalling by Promoting
Autophagic Degradation of p85α to Drive Tumorigenesis ,” elucidates a novel
therapeutic strategy against tumors by disrupting the interaction between
NLRP6 and p85α to inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway. The robust system of innate
immunity serves as the organism's initial shield against pathogens,
recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through a series of
pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These PRRs, which include the likes of
C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), Toll-like
receptors (TLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), function not only to thwart
infection but also to safeguard internal stability. Zooming in on NLRs, they
emerge as a specialized category of intracellular proteins capable of
identifying a diverse array of ligands emanating from microbial pathogens,
host cells, and environmental sources, thereby playing a pivotal role in
orchestrating the innate immune response. While a wealth of studies have
delved into the role of various NLRs—such as NOD1, NOD2, and NLRP3—in
activating innate immune signaling pathways, with NOD1 and NOD2 known to
activate the NF-κB signaling pathway upon encountering their respective PAMPs,
the direct interaction of NLRs with subunits of PI3K, influencing the PI3K/AKT
signaling pathway in gliomas, remains unverified. In the burgeoning field of
protein interactions as potential therapeutic targets, the alpha-helix has
established itself as a crucial recognition element, providing a promising
inhibitory model for macromolecule interactions. The research brings to light
the fact that NLRP6 promotes the degradation of p85α by establishing a direct
interaction with it, consequently propelling tumor growth. The study
introduces a compelling anti-tumor effect by interfering with the NLRP6/p85α
interaction via Pep9. It highlights that NLRP6, serving as a bridging protein
that interacts with p85α, recruits RBX1 to ubiquitinate p85α through the OPTN-
mediated autophagic degradation pathway, subsequently activating the PI3K/AKT

Materials (IF: 32)! This study presents a new nanocarrier, Cellular Membrane-
Engineered Nanovesicle (CMEV), for treating ischemic cardiomyopathy. CMEV
targets lesions with neutrophil-like migration, accumulates using an embedded
antibody, and releases a therapeutic peptide (CST) to enhance cardiac
function. August 27, 2023 · Publications, News On August 17 th , a research
paper entitled " Cellular Membrane-Engineered Nanovesicles as Three-Stage
Booster to Target Lesion Core " was published in the prestigious academic
journal Advanced Materials (impact factor: 32.086) by collaborated research
group led by Professor Wei Jin, Professor Wenguo Cui and Professor Ke Yang
from the School of Medicine at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. This study
introduces a novel nanocarrier, the Cellular Membrane-Engineered Nanovesicle
(CMEV), for the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy. This nanocarrier is
constructed using a double emulsion-extrusion method and has a hierarchical
structure, integrating a neutrophil membrane, functional antibody, and gelled
drug-loaded core as a 'three-stage booster' to target the lesion core and
deliver Catestatin (CST), a small therapeutic peptide. By coating the shell
with a neutrophil membrane, the CMEV is endowed with the function of
neutrophil-like migration to achieve the first stage of tissue targeting.
Based on specific anchoring to injured myocardium, the Myosin Light Chain 3
(MLC3) antibody was embedded to fulfill the second stage of CMEV accumulation
in the lesion core. The gelled core containing CST-sodium alginate (NaAlg)
with a pH-responsive shell is prepared by ionic cross-linking to accomplish
the third stage of precise CST administration. Triggered by the
microenvironment, NaAlg electrostatically adheres to the lesion core for
sustained release, enhancing the efficacy of CST in improving cardiomyocyte
apoptosis, excessive fibrosis, macrophage polarization, and angiogenesis.
Thus, the "three-stage booster" nanovesicle significantly ameliorates cardiac
function and adverse remodeling to treat ischemic cardiomyopathy. This
research provides a novel and effective approach for treating ischemic
cardiomyopathy. https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202302801 In this research study,
aqueous CST (6 mg/mL) is synthesized by SBS Genetech Co., Ltd.. Since 2000,
SBS Genetech has been at the forefront of providing solutions in life

Molecular sieves are used to adsorb trace amounts of water in solutions and
are designed for the synthesis of oligonucleotides. They are intended for
synthetic environments with water content below 10 ppm, while ensuring that no
dust, fuzz, or other impurities affect the synthesis process. We recommend
using 2g of molecular sieve for 50-250ml reagent bottles, 5g for 250-500ml
reagent bottles, 10g for 500-1000ml reagent bottles, and 20g for 1000-4000ml
reagent bottles. Since we typically use acetonitrile and tetrazole with very
low water content, you can use them in synthesis after adding the molecular
sieve for at least one hour. However, if acetonitrile and tetrazole have been
stored for an extended period without proper sealing, please add the molecular
sieve at least two days in advance. The main purpose of our molecular sieve is
to maintain low water content in the synthesis reagents, and it is essential
to ensure the sealing of the reagent bottles during the synthesis process.
Specifications We recommend TP-2 for 50-250ml, TP-5 for 250-500ml, TP-10 for
500-1000ml, and TP-20 for 1000-2000ml. Instruction The molecular sieve is
vacuum-sealed, and care should be taken when opening it to avoid puncturing
the packaging film. Check for any damage to the packaging film, and then place
it inside the reagent bottle. Ensure that the pipette used for synthetic
reagents does not puncture the molecular sieve packet, and maintain the
sealing of the reagent bottle during use. Only for research and not intended

For more details, please check here: Bst P DNA/RNA Polymerase . Description At SBS Genetech, we are at the forefront of offering solutions for isothermal amplification based on our world-class platform. Our Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is at the core of this platform, which is a mixture of Bst polymerase and extremely thermostable reverse transcriptase. Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is suitable for isothermal amplification reaction of both DNA and RNA templates, which can detect low-sensitivity nucleic acid templates with great efficiency and specificity. Besides, with a special preparation process, this enzyme has a fast amplification rate and high tolerance to impurity. This product has a high concentration (32U/μl) and is glycerol-free, which can be used to establish a freeze-drying system. Strong Recognition Ability to dUTP Bst DNA/RNA polymerase has a strong recognition ability to dUTP. The dTTP needed for amplification reaction can be completely replaced by dUTP, so the amplification products all contain dUTP. By adding our Heat-Labile Uracil DNA Glycosylase (HL-UDG) , aerosol pollutants will be completely removed in the initial reaction stage. The HL-UDG can be later inactivated irreversibly within 3 min at 65°C, which not only eliminates the pollutants but also ensures the normal amplification of nucleic acid. Therefore, the false positive caused by aerosol pollution in the reaction can be greatly reduced. Comparison Storage Conditions Store the components at -20°C. Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.

Dive into the Multifaceted World of Bst Polymerases, Providing Illuminating
Insights and Practical Guidance to Seamlessly Align Your Selection with
Research Objectives. · Isothermal Amp Journeying through the complexities of
isothermal amplification research, especially when pinpointing the most
suitable Bst enzyme variant for your specific needs, can be an intricate
endeavor. With a burgeoning spectrum of Bst types available, making a decision
can be overwhelming. Let us shed light on the assorted Bst enzymes and help
you identify a variant that flawlessly matches your research goals. The
crucial first step is to unequivocally define your project’s objectives since
the optimal Bst is inherently linked to them. Bst DNA Polymerase Large
Fragment: For conventional strand displacement reaction Bst DNA Polymerase
Large Fragment is the portion of the Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA
Polymerase protein that contains the 5´ → 3´ polymerase activity, but lacks 5´
→3´ exonuclease activity. It has basic strand displacement activity and can be
used for isothermal amplification. However, without further genetic
engineering, the amplification speed, impurity tolerance, and specificity of
Bst DNA Polymerase (Large Fragment) are not ideal. So we don't recommend this
enzyme for most of your experiments. Bst DNA Polymerase Large Fragment l atest

version of Bst Bst DNA Polymerase: Ideal for isothermal amplification of DNA
template Bst DNA Polymerase is also derived from Bacillus stearothermophilus
DNA polymerase I. Its 5 '- 3' exonuclease activity was removed by genetic
engineering, while the 5 '- 3' polymerase activity was retained. As the name
suggests, Bst DNA Polymerase has a strong strand-displacement ability for DNA
template, so it is an excellent enzyme for isothermal amplification. Compared
with wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large fragment), Bst DNA Polymerase has
been greatly improved in terms of amplification speed, yield, salt tolerance,
and thermal stability. At the same time, Bst DNA Polymerase can be amplified
with dUTP as substrate, while Bst DNA Polymerase (Large Fragment) has no such
activity. Bst DNA Polymerase is ideal for the isothermal amplification of DNA

engineering, while the 5'- 3' polymerase activity was retained. Compared with
wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large fragment) and Bst DNA Polymerase , Bst
Polymerase has better isothermal amplification activity and stronger reverse
transcription activity. Single enzyme system reaction can be realized in the
isothermal amplification experiment with RNA as a template. Bst Polymerase has
good reverse transcription activity at 60-65°C, which can effectively solve
the reverse transcription of the RNA template with secondary complex
structure, while Bst DNA Polymerase and wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large

suitable for isothermal amplification reaction of both DNA and RNA templates,
which can detect low-sensitivity nucleic acid templates with great efficiency
and specificity. Besides, with a special preparation process, this enzyme has
a fast amplification rate and high tolerance to impurity. Since Bst DNA/RNA
Polymerase is extremely thermostable and also provides sensitive reverse
transcriptase activity, it is reported to have higher sensitivity at high Ct
values. [1] Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is ideal for isothermal amplification of

When compared to the large fragment of Bst DNA Polymerase, it exhibits stronger 5'→3' DNA polymerase activity, enhanced strand displacement capability, tolerance to dUTP, salt resistance, and resistance to non-ionic detergents. Bst DNA Polymerase lacks 5'→3' and 3'→5' exonuclease activity. It can be used in various applications, including loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), crossing priming amplification (CPA), rolling-circle amplification (RCA), and isothermal amplification reactions based on rolling-circle amplification. The isothermal amplification temperature mediated by Bst DNA Polymerase generally falls between 50-68°C, typically at 65°C. The optimal temperature depends on the primers and the products being amplified and may require experimental optimization. Compared to the Bst 2.0 DNA Polymerase from similar companies, this product exhibits similar enzyme activity, comparable high dUTP tolerance, similar high tolerance to non-ionic detergents, and equivalent salt resistance . Source Bst DNA Polymerase is obtained through recombinant expression and purification in Escherichia coli. Purity Free from DNA endonuclease and exonuclease activities. Applications Suitable for various DNA isothermal amplification techniques, including loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), crossing priming amplification (CPA), rolling-circle amplification (RCA), helicase-dependent amplification (HDA), multiple displacement amplification (MDA), strand displacement DNA synthesis, whole-genome amplification (WGA), high GC-content DNA sequencing, rapid sequencing of nanogram-level DNA templates, library sequencing, and more.

Return to site SBS Genetech: Leading the Next Generation Isothermal
Amplification Technology The viewpoint of isothermal amplification industry,
invited by APAC CIO Outlook March 30, 2021 · Isothermal Amp, News Recently,
SBS Genetech was invited by APAC CIO Outlook , a digital and print magazine
that identify and profile emerging companies providing cutting edge solutions
to enterprises in APAC, to share the viewpoint of isothermal amplification
industry. Full text reads as follows. SBS Genetech: Leading the Next
Generation Isothermal Amplification Technology SBS Genetech, Published:
2020-03-30 Nucleic acid testing technology has developed rapidly in recent
years, especially in the field of molecular diagnosis. At present, the
mainstream of nucleic acid testing techniques in the market is based on
quantitative PCR technology (qPCR), which features strong specificity and high
sensitivity. This technology can quantitatively detect pathogens and achieve
high-throughput detection. However, the amplification process of qPCR requires
thermal cycling instruments. Due to their large volume, high price and long
reaction time, the application of thermal cycling instruments in grass-roots
units and on-site detection are very limited. Compared with other nucleic acid
testing techniques, isothermal amplification has the advantages of high
sensitivity and rapidity of reaction, and does not need special equipment.
Therefore, isothermal amplification has been considered by many researchers
and scientists as a detection method which may be comparable with qPCR
technology. At SBS Genetech, we are at the forefront of offering solutions for
isothermal amplification based on our world-class platform. Our Bst DNA/RNA
Polymerase is at the core of this platform, which is a mixture of Bst
polymerase and extremely thermostable reverse transcriptase. Bst DNA/RNA
Polymerase is suitable for isothermal amplification reaction of both DNA and
RNA templates, which can detect low-sensitivity nucleic acid templates with
great efficiency and sensitivity. Besides, with special preparation process,
this enzyme has fast amplification rate and high tolerance to impurity. Based
on this special enzyme, we have developed PrimeIamp TM lyophilized isothermal
amplification microbeads series . This series are ready-to-use master mixes,
which can perform the isothermal amplification directly when the templates and
primers are added. With freeze-drying technology, these master mixes are
lyophilized into solid microbeads, which can be transported and stored at room
temperature with great convenience. Combined with different detection
techniques, we have developed three types of microbeads so far: PrimeIAmp™ Red
Lyophilized Isothermal Amplification Microbeads , PrimeIAmp™ HNB Fluorescent
Dye Lyophilized Isothermal Amplification Microbeads , and PrimeIAmp™ SG
Lyophilized Isothermal Amplification Microbeads . PrimeIAmp™ Red Lyophilized
Isothermal Amplification Microbeads combines our world-class isothermal
amplification technology with red-yellow colorimetric visualization technique.
After amplification, the positive samples are yellow, while the negative
samples are red. The results can be directly observed by naked eyes without
any other auxiliary equipment. PrimeIAmp™ HNB Lyophilized Isothermal
Amplification Microbeads utilizes similar strategy. With HNB dye, the positive
samples are sky blue, while the negative samples are violet. PrimeIAmp™ SG
Fluorescent Dye Lyophilized Isothermal Amplification Microbeads is somehow
different as its dye is specially designed for real-time fluorescence
detection. One area of widespread concern about the isothermal amplification
is that with high-speed amplification characteristics, isothermal
amplification will inevitably lead to false positive amplification, especially
when primers are at high concentration. Fortunately, with our optimized
reaction buffer and unique colorimetric visualization and negative control
technique, our platform provides much higher sensitivity and specificity.
Besides, our Bst DNA/RNA polymerase has strong recognition ability to dUTP.
The dTTP needed for amplification reaction can be completely replaced by dUTP,
so the amplification products all contain dUTP. By adding our Heat-Labile
Uracil DNA Glycosylase (HL-UDG), aerosol pollutants will be completely removed
in the initial reaction stage. The HL-UDG can be later inactivated
irreversibly within 3 min at 65℃, which not only eliminates the pollutants,
but also ensures the normal amplification of nucleic acid. Therefore, the
false positive caused by aerosol pollution in the reaction can be greatly
reduced. Isothermal amplification is an emerging field and we are very excited
to be a part of it. Isothermal amplification technology and qPCR technology
have a strong technical complementarity. The advantage of qPCR lies in the
high-throughput testing in the central laboratory, while isothermal
amplification technology is better at real-time and rapid on-site detection.
They are more complementary than competitive. At SBS Genetech, we will keep
pushing the technology forward to meet the needs of scientists and researchers
in both academia and industry with our continuous efforts. You can also find

molecule in cellular metabolism, serving as the primary methyl group donor in
a wide range of biological methylation reactions. These reactions encompass
nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small molecule metabolism. SAM's primary
role is as a methyl donor. It transfers its methyl group to various substrates
in reactions catalyzed by a group of enzymes known as methyltransferases. Upon
donating its methyl group, SAM is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH).
This reaction is reversible, and SAH can be subsequently recycled back to
methionine. Cas No. 485-80-3 Storage The minimum shelf life is 1 year under

oligonucleotide hybridization probes that can report the presence of specific
nucleic acids in homogenous solutions. Get a Quote More Details Molecular
Beacons have a fluorescent reporter and a quencher at their 5' and 3' ends,
respectively. The sequence of these probes is designed so that they form a
hairpin structure in which the fluorescent dye and the quencher are in close
proximity. A Molecular Beacon specific for the sequence of interest is used in
PCR. The probe is designed to anneal between the PCR primers. When the probe
hybridizes to its target sequence in the PCR annealing step, the loop opens
and the fluorescent reporter and quencher are separated, resulting in a
fluorescent signal. The amount of signal is proportional to the amount of
target sequence and is measured in real-time to allow quantification of the
amount of target sequence. Beijing SBS Genetech is a licensed supplier of
Molecular Beacons, and offers a large number of fluorescent reporters and
different quenchers. Molecular Beacons with a dabcyl quencher and a variety of
different fluorescent reporters can be conveniently ordered from Beijing SBS
Genetech. All Molecular Beacons provided are HPLC purified. Turn-around time
is about 3-4 working days. Others are available upon request. Only for

Oligonucleotide conjugates are powerful molecular-engineering materials where
oligonucleotides links with ligands such as peptides, antibodies,
carbohydrates, or other small molecules. With the breakthroughs in linker
chemistry and drug delivery technologies, these chimeric molecules offer the
opportunity to deliver the oligonucleotide to specific cells and tissues and
thus modulate the disease-causing targets and further treat the diseases. By
conjugating oligonucleotides with various types of ligands, the
pharmacokinetic properties of oligonucleotides are improved and the scope of
applications in therapeutic cell targeting and protein diagnostics are
expanded. Get a Quote More Details Galnac Oligonucleotides Asialoglycoprotein
receptor (ASGPR) is an endocytic receptor specifically expressed by
hepatocytes. In recent years, using the high-affinity ligand
N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) of ASGPR as the targeting molecule, a
breakthrough has been made in the liver targeted delivery of oligonucleotide
drugs (siRNA, ASO, microRNA). We can provide various oligonucleotides and
GalNAc conjugates according to customer needs. GalNAc siRNA is a single
conjugate formed by carbohydrate compounds and siRNA. GalNAc is a targeted
ligand of the sialic acid receptor (ASGPR). It has high affinity and rapid
internalization ability with liver surface cells so that this kind of siRNA
conjugate can specifically bind membrane proteins and then get into cells. It
was found that when the single dose of GalNAc siRNA conjugate was 1 mg/ml, the
subcutaneous injection could effectively silence specific target genes in the
liver, and the silencing efficiency was higher than that of siRNA encapsulated
in lipid nanoparticles. These siRNA conjugates have good application potential
in the treatment of liver-related diseases involving gene overexpression. In
the early application research, researchers have applied GalNAc to the
delivery of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). It was found that the conjugation
modification of GalNAc can improve the efficiency of the second generation ASO
in mouse liver by 6-10 times. Compared with the previous generation of 2'- MOE
modified ASO, combining GalNAc conjugation with the next generation of cEt
modified ASO can improve the efficiency of ASO by 60 times. In addition to the
above siRNA and ASO, GalNAc is also applied to the delivery of microRNA
antagonistic nucleic acid. GalNAc-microRNA has already been used for the
treatment of hepatitis C. The core molecule of the drug is the antagonistic
nucleic acid of miRNA-122. The antagonistic nucleic acid is connected with a
GalNAc, which can be efficiently uptaken by hepatocytes and inhibit the
expression of miRNA-122, so as to achieve a good anti-hepatitis C therapeutic
effect (miRNA-122 is very important for HCV virus replication). Peptide
Oligonucleotides Oligonucleotides can be used not only as the key raw
materials of diagnostic reagents but also as gene therapy drugs. Because of
its high specificity and good selectivity, it is considered to be an effective
cancer treatment drug. However, after decades of research, oligonucleotides
have not become a common and effective drug for cancer treatment. The main
reasons are poor cell permeability, easy degradation by enzymes, off-target
effect, and so on. The research of peptides is earlier than that of
oligonucleotides, and the mechanism is relatively clear. It has better
membrane permeability and a strong anti-degradation ability. Therefore,
coupling oligonucleotides with peptides with various biological functions can
not only improve the biological activity of oligonucleotides but also improve
their cell permeability. We can provide conjugates of various oligonucleotides
and peptides, such as peptide-siRNA, peptide-DNA, peptide-RNA, RGD-siRNA, etc.
PEG Oligonucleotides The half-life of oligonucleotide drugs (aptamer, siRNA,
Aso, microRNA) in vivo is very short. And the structure of oligonucleotide
drugs is also easy to be damaged by various enzymes. Besides, the clearance by
the kidney is also very fast, which is not conducive to the maintenance of a
certain concentration of drugs. At the same time, oligonucleotides themselves
have a strong negative charge and are not easy to get close to the same
negatively charged cell membrane, so as to reduce their chances of uptake by
cells and reduce the efficacy. The above points limit the clinical application
of oligonucleotides. Although the modification of the oligonucleotide drug
skeleton and the modification of the phosphodiester bond into
thiophosphodiester bond can increase its resistance to nuclease, the in vivo
half-life of oligonucleotide drugs still can not reach an ideal length of
time, which limits the clinical application. PEG modification can effectively
solve the problem of such drugs. In the study of antisense oligonucleotide
(ASO), it was found that the half-life of PEG-modified ASO with thiophosphate
diester bond as the skeleton was prolonged, which was ten times that of
ordinary ASO. At the same time, macromolecular PEG can increase the molecular
weight and volume of oligonucleotide drugs, making it difficult for them to
pass through the glomerular filtration membrane and reduce the excretion rate
of the kidney, so as to effectively prolong the retention time of drugs in the
circulatory system and improve their biological activity. In addition, PEG can
also form a three-dimensional protective film in water, which is wound on the
surface of oligonucleotide drugs to shield the negative charge on the surface,
which is conducive to the uptake of oligonucleotide drugs by corresponding
cells and improve the effect. We can provide various conjugates of
oligonucleotides (PEG-Aptamer, PEG-siRNA, PEG-ASO) and PEG (mPEG, DSPE PEG,
Branched PEG, Biotin PEG, FITC PEG, DBCO PEG, Azide PEG, etc.) Radiolabelled
Oligonucleotides At present, PET with high sensitivity and high spatial
resolution is a leading technology in the field of molecular imaging. PET
combined with probes that can specifically bind to molecular targets can
qualitatively and quantitatively study the process of tumorigenesis and
development at the cellular and molecular level, with the advantages of in
vivo , noninvasive, repetitive, and real-time. Aptamers have a strong affinity
at low concentrations and can be chemically modified and labeled. Therefore,
the use of radiolabeled high specific aptamer probes has unique advantages in
tumor diagnosis. In addition, the application of siRNA in vivo also faces some
urgent problems to be solved, such as the off-target effect of siRNA in vivo
treatment, non-specific transport and distribution, and the potential risk of
activating the immune response. The in vivo distribution of siRNA is very
important for RNAi technology to play a role. Therefore, the development of
appropriate methods to evaluate the in vivo distribution of siRNA has
attracted more and more attention. The methods used to evaluate the
distribution in vivo include invasive measurement and noninvasive imaging.
Invasive measurement refers to the evaluation of the distribution of probes by
measuring the concentration of probes in isolated organs after killing
experimental animals. Noninvasive imaging technology mainly includes
radionuclide imaging, fluorescence imaging, and optical imaging technology.
These technologies provide feasibility for noninvasive tracking of siRNA in
vivo . Radionuclide tracing, as a widely used imaging technology in clinical
and scientific research, has the characteristics of noninvasive, high
sensitivity, and strong specificity. Compared with fluorescence and optical
imaging technology, radionuclide imaging is non-toxic and safe, especially for
large animals and even human body imaging. The application of radioactive
tracer technology in siRNA in vivo imaging provides technical support for
radionuclide therapy based on siRNA in the future. It can not only directly
evaluate the therapeutic effect, but also achieve the dual therapeutic effect
of RNAi gene therapy and radiotherapy, which is conducive to promoting the
development of RNAi technology in vivo application. We can provide
oligonucleotide conjugates with common radioactive markers (99mTc, 111In,
64Cu, 18F, etc., and chelating agents can be NOTA, DOTA, MAG, HYNIC, DTPA,
TETA, etc.). Oligonucleotide Fluorophores in the NIR Fluorescence imaging
technology is widely used in various biomedical research. Compared with the
commonly used fluorescence imaging technology, the near-infrared fluorescence
probe can significantly reduce the influence of light scattering and self
fluorescence effect when penetrating blood and tissue, and make the detection
depth deeper and the spatial resolution higher. The near-infrared fluorescence
probe is hopeful to play an important role in the fields of in vivo imaging,
early tumor diagnosis, and manual navigation in the future. We can provide
oligonucleotides (siRNA, DNA, aptamer, ASO) labeled with near-infrared
fluorescence (Cy7, Cy7.5, ICG, etc.), and can provide development and
synthesis services of various near-infrared fluorescent nucleic acid probes

50 kb are usually difficult to operate and inefficient in transformation and
assembly. In view of this problem, by optimizing the technology, we have
successfully assembled fragments above 100kb with much smaller fragments,
without the intermediate step of synthesizing 50 kb fragments, which results
in higher efficiency and lower cost. Fast delivery : with the fastest delivery

The Overview of Isothermal Amplification Technologies o... Return to site
Return to site The Overview of Isothermal Amplification Technologies of
Nucleic Acids Among these isothermal amplification technologies, Loop-mediated
isothermal amplification (LAMP), is particularly attracting attention. October
17, 2022 · Isothermal Amp Development of Isothermal Amplification Technologies
Since the invention of PCR technology in 1980, nucleic acid detection based on
PCR technology has been rapidly applied to clinical, food and environmental
detection, and has become the gold standard for nucleic acid detection.
However, PCR detection technology has many shortcomings, such as the large
size of equipment, poor tolerance of crude samples, long reaction time, and
difficulty in reaching single copy sensitivity. It has been difficult to meet
the requirements of modern nucleic acid detection: fast speed (<30min), super
sensitivity (1-5 copy/test), direct detection of a large volume of crude
samples (20-50% sample volume of reaction), field operation, simplified
operation, etc. In the past 20 years, scientists have been trying to achieve
the above goals through isothermal amplification, including Rolling Circle
Amplification (RCA), Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP),
Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA), Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based
Amplification (NASBA), Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA), Helicase-
dependent Amplification (HDA), Transcription-mediated Amplification (TMA) and
other isothermal amplification technologies. Among these isothermal
amplification technologies, the LAMP method, which was first reported in 2000,
is particularly attracting attention, and currently accounts for more than 60%
of the isothermal amplification detection market. The reason is that other
isothermal amplification technologies cannot achieve the comprehensive
advantages of LAMP technology: The reaction speed is extremely fast. The
optimized primer combination can detect a single copy molecule within 15
minutes, and the detection speed is close to or higher than RPA and NASBA. It
can reach the limit of hypersensitivity detection. Molecules of 1-5 copies can
be detected stably. It is difficult for any other isothermal amplification
technology to reach such a stable level. The diversity of interpretation forms
is suitable for rapid nucleic acid detection under various environments and
conditions. LAMP amplification, as a terminal interpretation form, can be used
to observe the detection results with the naked eye without any other
auxiliary equipment. For HNB and OG orange green discoloration, the results
can be observed with the naked eye. LAMP can also conduct real-time turbidity
analysis with the aid of a turbidity meter. After SYBR Green fluorescent dye
is added to the reaction system, a small constant temperature fluorometer can
be used for real-time detection. These results can be interpreted in the field
and other non-standard laboratories, and the required equipment is simple,
compact, cheap, and easy to popularize. In addition, the fluorescent
quantitative PCR instrument in the traditional laboratory can also be used for
LAMP detection. SYBR Green, MB probe method, or LAMP TaqMan probe method can
be used. For personnel who often operate PCR detection, it can be seamlessly
connected without changing equipment. The undetected rate of the RNA virus is
low. Because of the high mutation rate of the RNA virus, individual mutations
in PCR detection have a greater impact on PCR amplification, which is easy to
cause false negatives of the virus undetected. However, LAMP recognizes 8
segments of the target gene, and individual mutations in these recognition
segments have little impact on LAMP amplification, so it is not easy to miss
detection. The reagent is stable and easy to use. Compared with RPA, NASBA,
and other technologies, LAMP and PCR adopt a single enzyme (or double enzyme)
system for reaction, with a stable production batch, high-temperature
resistance of the reaction enzyme system, and good reagent stability. The
detection reagent only contains one tube of enzyme mix and one tube of
primer/probe, which is convenient to use. It can easily conduct high-
throughput detection on the fluorescent quantitative PCR machine. However,
RPA, NASBA, and other systems require multiple complex enzymes, with strict
proportion, difficult reagent stable production, harsh storage and
transportation conditions, and difficult for high-throughput application. The
LAMP method has the strongest tolerance to impurities. PCR, RPA, NASBA, and
other amplification systems all need nucleic acid purification and
preparation. In the direct amplification system for crude products, the sample
loading is small (<10%) and cannot be loaded in large volumes. Impurities have
a great impact on these amplification methods. The tolerance of the LAMP
method to most samples is more than 20%, and the content of individual samples
can be more than 50%. Such a large sample loading volume determines that LAMP
has a higher detection rate. The amplification reaction is synchronized with
virus inactivation. Since the LAMP reaction temperature is at 65 °C , the
virus can be inactivated during the direct expansion of the virus solution,
reducing the contamination risk of consumables. High specificity. With the
continuous improvement of the LAMP enzyme, reaction buffer, probe technology,
and primer design concept, the non-specific amplification of LAMP has been
improved qualitatively. At present, in the optimized LAMP system, the false
positive situation has been fundamentally improved, and the proportion of
false positives is close to or even lower than that of the PCR method.
Application of multiple fluorescent probes. With the continuous improvement of
the Bst polymerase and reaction buffer system and the invention of LAMP TaqMan
technology, multiplex LAMP systems have been established. This multiplex LAMP
technology has reached the same performance as the multi-target gene and
internal reference quality control samples of the gold standard TaqMan PCR and
meets the standard for clinical application. Isothermal Amplification Platform
of SBS Genetech Based on the R&D experience of molecular tool enzymes and
protein electronic reframing technology, SBS Genetech has established a
comprehensive isothermal amplification core enzyme platform, including Bst DNA
Polymerase , Bst Polymerase , and Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase . Bst DNA/RNA
Polymerase is at the core of our world-class platform By carefully optimized
reaction system, we have created PrimeIAmp ™ series with excellent
performance, high amplification efficiency and specificity. With freeze-drying
technology, PrimeIAmp™ series can be transported and stored at room
temperature. Diversified premixed chromogenic reagents meet different
detection requirements, including OG color change ( PrimeIAmp™ Basic
Lyophilized Isothermal Amplification Microbeads ), HNB color change (
PrimeIAmp™ HNB Lyophilized Isothermal Amplification Microbeads ), SYBR Green
fluorescence method ( PrimeIAmp™ SG Fluorescent Dye Lyophilized Isothermal
Amplification Microbeads ), etc. Besides, we have also developed anti-
contamination solution: PrimeIAmp™ Basic Isothermal Amplification MasterMix
(with UDG) . Thanks to the recognition of the dUTP substrate by Bst DNA/RNA
Polymerase, the reaction substrate does not contain dTTP, so the amplified
products are dUTP products, which can achieve anti-contamination in
combination with heat-labile UDG. In the actual test, the amplification of
contaminates was completely inhibited under the condition of containing 10 5
copies of contaminates. In addition, the isothermal amplification raw
materials provided by SBS Genetech are not limited to LAMP amplification. They
can also be used for isothermal amplification methods such as RCA (Rolling
Circle Amplification), HDA (Helicase Dependent Amplification), SMAP (Smart
Amplification Process), CPA (Crossing Priming Amplification), etc. Subscribe

Return to site Bst Polymerase: Unveiling the Potent and Humble Relative of Taq
Polymerase in Molecular Biology Explore the origins, properties, and diverse
applications of Bst polymerases, from conventional amplification to advanced
variants, guiding researchers in selecting the optimal enzyme for molecular
biology experiments. May 30, 2024 · Isothermal Amp In the intricate world of
molecular biology techniques, DNA polymerases play a pivotal role, acting as
molecular architects in the construction of genetic material. Among these, Bst
polymerase and Taq polymerase stand out as two indispensable tools, each with
its own set of characteristics and applications. While they may share
similarities in function, a closer examination reveals distinctive features
that make them suitable for different experimental needs. Originating from
different thermophilic bacteria, Bst polymerase and Taq polymerase boast
unique biological pedigrees. Bst polymerase emerges as a large fragment of DNA
polymerase I from Geobacillus stearothermophilus, a resilient bacterium
thriving in extreme thermal environments. In contrast, Taq polymerase finds
its roots in Thermus aquaticus, another thermophile known for its ability to
endure scorching temperatures. This disparity in origin sets the stage for the
subsequent differences in their properties and applications. Thermostability
serves as one of the most prominent distinctions between Bst polymerase and
Taq polymerase. Bst polymerase exhibits a moderate level of thermal stability,
making it an ideal candidate for isothermal DNA amplification methods. This
characteristic allows researchers to conduct DNA amplification reactions at a
constant temperature, simplifying experimental setups and reducing equipment
requirements. Conversely, Taq polymerase boasts exceptional thermostability,
capable of withstanding the rigorous temperature cycles of polymerase chain
reactions (PCR) without succumbing to denaturation. This resilience in the
face of extreme heat has cemented Taq polymerase's status as a cornerstone of
PCR technology. Another differentiating factor lies in the processivity of
these enzymes. Processivity refers to the enzyme's ability to catalyze
multiple reactions without dissociating from the template DNA. Bst polymerase
has been noted for its superior processivity compared to Taq polymerase,
enabling it to efficiently replicate long stretches of DNA with fewer
interruptions. This attribute makes Bst polymerase particularly valuable in
applications requiring the amplification of lengthy DNA fragments or complex
genomic regions. Fidelity, or the accuracy of DNA replication, also diverges
between Bst polymerase and Taq polymerase. Over the years, Bst polymerase has
undergone refinements aimed at enhancing its fidelity, salt tolerance, and
other critical characteristics. These improvements have led to a reduction in
error rates, bolstering the reliability of DNA amplification processes
involving Bst polymerase. Conversely, Taq polymerase is notorious for its
relatively high error rate, primarily attributed to the absence of a 3′–5′
exonuclease proofreading activity. Despite this drawback, Taq polymerase
remains indispensable in PCR applications, where rapid amplification often
takes precedence over absolute fidelity. The applications of Bst polymerase
and Taq polymerase reflect their unique properties and strengths in molecular
biology research and diagnostics. Bst polymerase finds widespread use in
isothermal DNA amplification methods such as Loop-Mediated Isothermal
Amplification (LAMP), Whole Genome Amplification (WGA), and Rolling Circle
Amplification (RCA). These techniques leverage Bst polymerase's strand
displacement activity and moderate thermostability to achieve rapid and robust
DNA amplification under isothermal conditions. On the other hand, Taq
polymerase remains a staple in conventional PCR applications, where its
exceptional thermostability and versatility make it indispensable for
amplifying specific DNA targets with high precision and efficiency. In
conclusion, while Bst polymerase and Taq polymerase share the common role of
DNA polymerases in molecular biology techniques, their distinct properties and
origins give rise to specialized applications. Bst polymerase, with its
moderate thermostability, superior processivity, and improved fidelity, excels
in isothermal DNA amplification methods. Meanwhile, Taq polymerase's
exceptional thermostability and versatility continue to make it the go-to
choice for traditional PCR applications. Understanding these differences
empowers researchers to select the most suitable enzyme for their specific
experimental needs, ultimately advancing the frontiers of molecular biology
research and diagnostics. At SBS Genetech, we have pioneered the development
of a diverse array of novel Bst polymerase variants meticulously tailored to
amplify their utility in molecular biology research and diagnostics. Let's
delve deeper into these groundbreaking solutions. Bst DNA Polymerase Large
Fragment: Cost-effective version for conventional strand displacement reaction
Bst DNA Polymerase Large Fragment is the portion of the Bacillus
stearothermophilus DNA Polymerase protein that contains the 5´ → 3´ polymerase
activity, but lacks 5´ →3´ exonuclease activity. It has basic strand
displacement activity and can be used for isothermal amplification. However,
without further genetic engineering, the amplification speed, impurity
tolerance, and specificity of Bst DNA Polymerase (Large Fragment) are not
ideal. So we don't recommend this enzyme for most of your experiments. Bst DNA
Polymerase: Ideal for isothermal amplification of DNA template Bst DNA
Polymerase is also derived from Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA polymerase I.
Its 5 '- 3' exonuclease activity was removed by genetic engineering, while the
5 '- 3' polymerase activity was retained. As the name suggests, Bst DNA
Polymerase has a strong strand-displacement ability for DNA template, so it is
an excellent enzyme for isothermal amplification. Compared with wild-type Bst
DNA polymerase (large fragment), Bst DNA Polymerase has been greatly improved
in terms of amplification speed, yield, salt tolerance, and thermal stability.
At the same time, Bst DNA Polymerase can be amplified with dUTP as substrate,
while Bst DNA Polymerase (Large Fragment) has no such activity. Bst
Polymerase: For isothermal amplification of both DNA and RNA template with a
single enzyme system Bst Polymerase is also derived from Bacillus
stearothermophilus DNA polymerase I. Its 5'- 3' and 3'-5' exonuclease activity
was removed by genetic engineering, while the 5'- 3' polymerase activity was
retained. Compared with wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large fragment) and Bst
DNA Polymerase , Bst Polymerase has better isothermal amplification activity
and stronger reverse transcription activity. Single enzyme system reaction can
be realized in the isothermal amplification experiment with RNA as a template.
Bst Polymerase has good reverse transcription activity at 60-65°C, which can
effectively solve the reverse transcription of the RNA template with secondary
complex structure, while Bst DNA Polymerase and wild-type Bst DNA polymerase
(large fragment) do not have this activity. Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase: Ideal for
isothermal amplification of RNA template Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is a mixture
of Bst Polymerase and extremely thermostable reverse transcriptase (65°C
tolerant), which is suitable for the isothermal amplification reaction of RNA.
It can detect low-sensitivity RNA molecules. Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is
suitable for isothermal amplification reaction of both DNA and RNA templates,
which can detect low-sensitivity nucleic acid templates with great efficiency
and specificity. Besides, with a special preparation process, this enzyme has
a fast amplification rate and high tolerance to impurity. Since Bst DNA/RNA
Polymerase is extremely thermostable and also provides sensitive reverse
transcriptase activity, it is reported to have higher sensitivity at high Ct
values. [1] Bst P DNA/RNA Polymerase: The most advanced enzyme solution Bst P
DNA/RNA Polymerase is an upgraded version of Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase through
enzyme electronic re-structure and evolution screening (in silico Design & in
vitro Evolution), which is generally used for LAMP or RT-LAMP amplification of
DNA or RNA. Performance improvements include: The whole Bst P DNA/RNA System
includes hot start Aptamer, which ensures that the enzyme activity blocking
efficiency is >95% at <30°C, and the enzyme activity is completely released
within 1 min at >60°C. This characteristic facilitates the establishment of
the reaction system at room temperature and greatly reduces the non-specific
amplification at low temperatures. The reaction temperature is further raised
to 70°C, which greatly reduces the formation of primer dimer, improves the
amplification specificity, and makes the nucleic acid release of crude samples
more sufficient. The whole portfolio contains Helicase, so Premium LAMP
amplification (pLAMP) is allowed without using F3/B3 primers. At the same
time, Helicase has the function of assisting in strand unwinding, which
further reduces the concentration of FIP/BIP primers. This will further reduce
non-specific amplification and greatly improve amplification homogeneity.
Comparison between the most common Bst DNA Polymerase and the latest Bst P
DNA/RNA Polymerase In conclusion, the selection of a Bst polymerase variant is
intricately tied to research objectives, with each offering distinct
capabilities and benefits. Our diverse array of Bst polymerases at SBS
Genetech is meticulously curated to meet varied requirements. Reference [1] Lu

variants, including Bst DNA Polymerase Large Fragment, Bst DNA Polymerase, Bst
Polymerase, Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase, and Bst P DNA/RNA Polymerase, offer
tailored functionalities for diverse molecular biology techniques May 9, 2024
· Isothermal Amp The function of BST (Bacillus stearothermophilus) polymerase,
also known as Bst polymerase, is to catalyze the synthesis of DNA strands from
deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) using single-stranded DNA as a
template. This enzyme is widely used in molecular biology techniques such as
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA sequencing, site-directed mutagenesis,
and DNA labeling. BST polymerase, like other DNA polymerases, plays a crucial
role in DNA replication and amplification processes. It adds nucleotides to
the growing DNA strand in a template-dependent manner, utilizing the
complementary base pairing between the template strand and incoming
nucleotides (dNTPs). This results in the synthesis of a new DNA strand that is
complementary to the template. One notable feature of BST polymerase is its
high thermal stability, which allows it to withstand the high temperatures
required for denaturation steps in PCR. This characteristic makes it
particularly useful in isothermal amplification techniques where elevated
temperatures are necessary for DNA amplification without the need for thermal
cycling. In essence, Bst polymerase serves to facilitate the amplification and
replication of DNA molecules across a spectrum of molecular biology
applications, thereby contributing to advancements in research, diagnostics,
and biotechnology. At SBS Genetech, we've developed a range of novel Bst
polymerase variants endowed with additional functionalities. Let's delve
deeper into these innovations. Bst DNA Polymerase Large Fragment: Cost-

stearothermophilus DNA polymerase I. Its 5 '- 3' exonuclease activity was
removed by genetic engineering, while the 5 '- 3' polymerase activity was
retained. As the name suggests, Bst DNA Polymerase has a strong strand-
displacement ability for DNA template, so it is an excellent enzyme for
isothermal amplification. Compared with wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large
fragment), Bst DNA Polymerase has been greatly improved in terms of
amplification speed, yield, salt tolerance, and thermal stability. At the same
time, Bst DNA Polymerase can be amplified with dUTP as substrate, while Bst
DNA Polymerase (Large Fragment) has no such activity. Bst Polymerase: For
isothermal amplification of both DNA and RNA template with a single enzyme
system Bst Polymerase is also derived from Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA
polymerase I. Its 5'- 3' and 3'-5' exonuclease activity was removed by genetic
engineering, while the 5'- 3' polymerase activity was retained. Compared with
wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large fragment) and Bst DNA Polymerase , Bst
Polymerase has better isothermal amplification activity and stronger reverse
transcription activity. Single enzyme system reaction can be realized in the
isothermal amplification experiment with RNA as a template. Bst Polymerase has
good reverse transcription activity at 60-65°C, which can effectively solve
the reverse transcription of the RNA template with secondary complex
structure, while Bst DNA Polymerase and wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large
fragment) do not have this activity. Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase: Ideal for
isothermal amplification of RNA template Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is a mixture
of Bst Polymerase and extremely thermostable reverse transcriptase (65°C
tolerant), which is suitable for the isothermal amplification reaction of RNA.
It can detect low-sensitivity RNA molecules. Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is
suitable for isothermal amplification reaction of both DNA and RNA templates,
which can detect low-sensitivity nucleic acid templates with great efficiency
and specificity. Besides, with a special preparation process, this enzyme has
a fast amplification rate and high tolerance to impurity. Since Bst DNA/RNA
Polymerase is extremely thermostable and also provides sensitive reverse
transcriptase activity, it is reported to have higher sensitivity at high Ct
values. [1] Bst P DNA/RNA Polymerase: The most advanced enzyme solution Bst P
DNA/RNA Polymerase is an upgraded version of Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase through
enzyme electronic re-structure and evolution screening (in silico Design & in
vitro Evolution), which is generally used for LAMP or RT-LAMP amplification of
DNA or RNA. Performance improvements include: The whole Bst P DNA/RNA System
includes hot start Aptamer, which ensures that the enzyme activity blocking
efficiency is >95% at <30°C, and the enzyme activity is completely released
within 1 min at >60°C. This characteristic facilitates the establishment of
the reaction system at room temperature and greatly reduces the non-specific
amplification at low temperatures. The reaction temperature is further raised
to 70°C, which greatly reduces the formation of primer dimer, improves the
amplification specificity, and makes the nucleic acid release of crude samples
more sufficient. The whole portfolio contains Helicase, so Premium LAMP
amplification (pLAMP) is allowed without using F3/B3 primers. At the same
time, Helicase has the function of assisting in strand unwinding, which
further reduces the concentration of FIP/BIP primers. This will further reduce
non-specific amplification and greatly improve amplification homogeneity.
Comparison between the most common Bst DNA Polymerase and the latest Bst P
DNA/RNA Polymerase In conclusion, the selection of a Bst polymerase variant is
intricately tied to your research objectives, each offering distinct
capabilities and benefits. We trust this comprehensive overview will guide you

Primers? Learn how pLAMP simplifies primer design, enhances specificity, and
improves amplification homogeneity, making it ideal for medical diagnostics,
pathogen detection, and genetic research April 1, 2024 · Isothermal Amp Loop-
mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has emerged as a powerful and
versatile nucleic acid amplification technique, finding extensive applications
in medical diagnostics, pathogen detection, food safety monitoring, and
environmental surveillance. In comparison to PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction),
LAMP offers numerous advantages, including simplicity, rapidity, minimal
equipment requirements, and robustness against amplification inhibitors.
Typically, LAMP involves the utilization of 4-6 primers, comprising two sets
of specific primers: outer primers (F3 and B3) and inner primers (FIP and
BIP), along with 1-2 loop primers. The outer primers bind to regions flanking
the target sequence, while the inner primers bind within the target sequence.
Loop primers, on the other hand, target loop structures formed during the LAMP
reaction. The design of these primers is critical for efficient amplification,
ensuring specificity and compatibility with the isothermal conditions required
for LAMP. The role of loop primers in LAMP is to enhance the speed and
efficiency of amplification. As the LAMP reaction commences, loop primers bind
to the already-formed LAMP amplification products, facilitating the rapid
progression of the amplification process. Through this mechanism, loop primers
accelerate the attainment of equilibrium in the reaction, thereby increasing
the speed and yield of LAMP amplification. SBS Genetech 's unique Premium LAMP
(pLAMP) , based on the distinctive Bst P DNA/RNA Polymerase , represents a
significant advancement in LAMP technology by integrating Helicase enzyme into
the reaction mixture. This addition offers several advantages over traditional
LAMP techniques. Notably, pLAMP can operate without the need for outer primers
(F3/B3) due to the presence of Helicase enzyme, which facilitates the
unwinding of DNA strands. Consequently, pLAMP reactions can be initiated
solely with inner primers (FIP/BIP), streamlining primer design and reaction
setup. Furthermore, Helicase enzyme assists in the unwinding of DNA strands
during amplification, thereby reducing the concentration of FIP/BIP primers
required for efficient amplification. This reduction in primer concentration
minimizes non-specific amplification and enhances the uniformity of
amplification across target sequences, leading to improved specificity,
sensitivity, and reproducibility of pLAMP assays. In summary, Premium LAMP
(pLAMP) harnesses the capabilities of Helicase enzyme to streamline primer
design, reduce non-specific amplification, and improve amplification
homogeneity. These advancements make pLAMP an attractive option for various
applications, including diagnostic testing, pathogen detection, and genetic
research, further cementing LAMP's position as a leading molecular diagnostic
tool. For more information on our Premium LAMP (pLAMP) and Bst P DNA/RNA

Exploring the Key Players in Nucleic Acid Synthesis: NT... Return to site
Return to site Exploring the Key Players in Nucleic Acid Synthesis: NTP vs
dNTP vs ddNTP Delve into the importance of nucleoside triphosphates (NTP),
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTP), and dideoxynucleoside triphosphates
(ddNTP) in nucleic acid synthesis August 30, 2024 · PCR-Related In the vast
landscape of molecular biology, where understanding the intricacies of DNA and
RNA is paramount, researchers rely on a myriad of tools and resources to
unravel the mysteries of the genome. Among these essential components are NTPs
(Nucleoside Triphosphates), dNTPs (Deoxynucleoside Triphosphates), and ddNTPs
(Dideoxynucleoside Triphosphates), which serve as the fundamental building
blocks for DNA and RNA synthesis and sequencing. Here's what each one refers
to: NTP (Nucleoside Triphosphate): NTP stands for Nucleoside Triphosphate. It
consists of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar (ribose in
RNA or deoxyribose in DNA), and three phosphate groups. NTPs are used as
substrates in various cellular processes, including DNA and RNA synthesis,
where they provide the energy required for the polymerization reaction. In DNA
synthesis, deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) are used, while in RNA
synthesis, ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) are utilized. It's worth
noting that due to the prevalence of dNTPs in DNA synthesis, the term "NTP" is
sometimes used interchangeably with "rNTP" when referring to RNA synthesis.
dNTP (Deoxynucleoside Triphosphate): dNTPs are a subtype of NTPs where the
pentose sugar is deoxyribose. These molecules are used specifically in DNA
synthesis during replication and repair processes. There are four types of
dNTPs, each corresponding to one of the four nitrogenous bases found in DNA:
adenine (dATP), guanine (dGTP), cytosine (dCTP), and thymine (dTTP). ddNTP
(Dideoxynucleoside Triphosphate): ddNTPs are similar to dNTPs but lack the
3'-hydroxyl group on the sugar molecule. This lack of the hydroxyl group
prevents further DNA chain elongation because it cannot form a phosphodiester
bond with the next incoming nucleotide. ddNTPs are commonly used in Sanger
sequencing, a method for determining the sequence of nucleotides in DNA
strands. They terminate DNA synthesis when they are incorporated into the
growing DNA strand during replication. Sanger sequencing utilizes a mixture of
normal dNTPs and a small proportion of ddNTPs, which leads to the termination
of replication at specific positions, generating a set of DNA fragments of
different lengths that can be separated and read to determine the sequence of
the original DNA strand. In summary, NTPs are the general class of nucleoside
triphosphates used in various cellular processes, dNTPs are specifically used
in DNA synthesis, and ddNTPs are used in sequencing methods to terminate DNA
synthesis. Why Choose SBS Genetech's NTP, dNTP, and ddNTP? At SBS Genetech ,

Unveiling the Principles and Innovations of Taqman Tech... Return to site
Return to site Unveiling the Principles and Innovations of Taqman Technology
in Real-time PCR Detection Delve into the working principles of Taqman
technology, its crucial role in real-time PCR detection, and the innovative
solutions offered by SBS Genetech June 20, 2024 · PCR-Related Taqman
technology, as the gold standard for real-time fluorescence PCR detection, not
only possesses outstanding specificity, sensitivity, and user-friendliness but
also constitutes one of the fundamental principles of real-time PCR detection.
This article will delve into the working principles of Taqman technology,
aiming to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of its
operational mechanisms. Similar to traditional PCR reactions, Taqman-based
reactions require a double-stranded template and two specific primers.
However, unlike conventional PCR, Taqman detection also requires a third
specific sequence, namely the probe. The probe differs significantly from the
primers in structure and function. Firstly, the probe lacks a free hydroxyl
group, thus cannot be amplified by DNA polymerase. Secondly, the probe is
covalently linked to two other molecules, with a fluorescent moiety called the
reporter group at the 5' end and a quenching group at the 3' end. This design
enables the probe to play a crucial role in PCR reactions. During the PCR
reaction, the probe binds to the target DNA. When the DNA polymerase
encounters the probe during the extension phase and possesses exonuclease
activity, it cleaves the probe into fragments. This process physically
separates the reporter group and the quenching group, thereby triggering the
emission of fluorescence from the reporter group. This emission signal is
directly proportional to the generation of PCR products, enabling real-time
monitoring of PCR reactions. The design of Taqman technology ingeniously
utilizes the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). In
the structure of the probe, the reporter group and the quenching group are
very close in distance. When the quenching group receives energy, it transfers
it to the reporter group, leading to quenching of the fluorescence signal.
However, when the probe binds to the target DNA and is cleaved by DNA
polymerase, the reporter group and the quenching group are permanently
separated, thereby triggering an increase in the fluorescence signal. This
process provides reliable signals for real-time PCR, enabling precise
detection and quantification of PCR products. Real-time PCR instruments can
monitor and record the increase in fluorescence signal after each PCR cycle
and generate amplification plots. These data can be further analyzed for
diagnosis, research, and other applications. In addition to the basic
principles, we also make innovations at SBS Genetech . We have introduced
double-quenched probes , solving the issue of fluorescence "leakage" in
traditional probes as the length increases, thus improving detection
sensitivity. We also utilize high-throughput DNA synthesis technology to
achieve individual synthesis and purification of each sequence, controlling
the synthesis yield at the pmol level, known as pmol-scale DNA Capture Probe
Synthesis Service . Compared to traditional column-based synthesis methods,
this approach saves raw materials, reduces costs, and is more suitable for
downstream applications. These innovations have enabled Taqman technology to
play a crucial role in the field of molecular diagnostics, providing powerful
tools for research and clinical diagnosis in medicine, biology, and other
fields. Through a deep understanding of its working principles and the
introduction of innovative technologies, we can better apply them in practice
and drive the development and innovation of molecular diagnostic technologies.
At SBS Genetech, we are committed to providing more advanced technologies and
solutions to help our customers maintain a competitive edge in the market.

Reactions Navigating Internal and External Variables for Successful PCR
Amplification February 19, 2024 · PCR-Related PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)
stands as a cornerstone technique in molecular biology, empowering a wide
array of applications ranging from gene detection to pathogen identification.
Yet, the efficacy of PCR assays can be compromised by inhibitory factors that
lurk within the reaction milieu. These inhibitory factors may emanate from
both internal components and external contaminants, posing challenges to the
accuracy and reliability of PCR results. Internal Factors in PCR Reactions 1\.
Primer Design: PCR primers, synthesized custom DNA oligonucleotides , play a
pivotal role in determining the specificity and efficiency of PCR
amplification. The success of PCR largely depends on adhering to certain
principles in primer design. Optimal Primer Length : Primers typically range
from 15 to 30 nucleotides in length. Excessively long primers hinder binding
to the template and may form secondary structures, while overly short ones
compromise specificity. Appropriate GC Content : The GC content of primers
should ideally fall within the range of 40% to 60%. Consistency in GC content
between forward and reverse primers is crucial for balanced annealing. Extreme
GC content can impede primer-template annealing. The bases at the 3' end of
the primer generally avoid A/T pairs because A/T pairs have only 2 hydrogen
bonds (compared to 3 in G/C pairs), which relatively increases the efficiency
of mispriming. Additionally, the 3' end should prevent consecutive C or G
bases because continuous GC pairs are detrimental to the binding of the
primer's 3' end with the template. Avoidance of Complementary Sequences :
Primers must not contain complementary sequences to each other or within
themselves. Random distribution of bases is essential to prevent primer dimer
formation, which can interfere with template annealing. Consideration of
Terminal Modifications : While modifications at the 5' end of primers can
enhance specificity, modifications at the 3' end should be avoided as they can
interfere with extension. Modifications at the 5' end include enzyme cleavage
sites, fluorescent or biotin labels, introduction of point mutations,
insertions, deletions, or promoter sequences. Optimal Tm Values : The melting
temperature (Tm) of primer-template pairs should ideally fall between 55°C to
80°C. Consistency in Tm values between forward and reverse primers ensures
balanced annealing, typically not exceeding a 5°C difference. Prevention of
Secondary Structures : Primers should be designed from genomic regions less
prone to forming secondary structures to avoid hindrance in amplification.
Avoidance of Terminator Codons : Terminal primer bases should not correspond
to terminator codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) as the third position of these codons is
prone to degeneracy, affecting amplification specificity and efficiency. 2\.
Primer quality : It's essential to ensure that the oligos are synthesized with
a high coupling efficiency, ideally around 99%. Purification methods such as
RPC, PAGE, or HPLC can further enhance the quality by removing impurities.
High coupling efficiency allows for the synthesis of longer oligos, up to 200
bases, while modifications can be tailored to specific research needs.
Additionally, analyzing oligos through PAGE and employing techniques like
Maldi-Tof Mass QC can provide assurance of their quality and reliability for
PCR applications. These measures collectively contribute to obtaining accurate
and reproducible results in molecular biology experiments. 3\. Enzyme and its
concentration : Excessive enzyme concentration can lead to nonspecific
amplification, while too low a concentration reduces the synthesis of
products. 4\. Quality and concentration of dNTPs : The dNTP solution is
typically acidic, with adjustments made to achieve a pH of 7.0-7.5 during
system preparation. Ideally, under standard conditions, the concentrations of
all four dNTPs should be equal. Deviations from this balance can lead to
issues such as mispriming if one dNTP is excessively high, or reduced PCR
product yield if concentrations are too low. To mitigate these risks, we
recommend opting for a ready-to-use dNTPs mix solution containing dATP, dCTP,
dGTP, and dTTP (monosodium salts) at an identical concentration, dissolved in
sterile deionized water at pH 7.5. This solution should exhibit a purity of
≥99% as determined by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis,
and importantly, it should be free of RNase and DNase contaminants. 5\.
Nucleic acid template : The quantity, purity, and integrity of the template
all affect the PCR reaction. 6\. Mg2+ concentration : Mainly affects the
specificity and yield of PCR amplification, generally corresponding to the
concentration of dNTPs. An excessively high Mg2+ concentration reduces
specificity, leading to nonspecific amplification, while too low a
concentration decreases the activity of Taq DNA polymerase, resulting in
reduced product yield. 7\. Temperature and time settings : PCR involves three
temperature points—denaturation, annealing, and extension—each with its own
time setting. For templates with high GC content, the denaturation time should
be extended. If the primer has a low number of bases, annealing temperature
can be raised slightly to increase PCR specificity; conversely, if the primer
has a high number of bases, annealing temperature can be lowered to facilitate
primer binding to the DNA template. For longer product lengths, extension time
should be extended accordingly. 8\. Number of cycles : The number of cycles
determines the extent of PCR amplification, primarily dependent on the
concentration of template DNA. The more cycles, the higher the amount of
nonspecific products and the higher the rate of base misincorporation.
External Factors in PCR Reactions SDS (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate) : Anionic
detergent that can disrupt the non-covalent bonds (hydrogen bonds and
hydrophobic interactions) of enzyme proteins, binding to the hydrophobic
regions of proteins, thereby denaturing enzyme proteins and causing loss of
their natural conformation and function. A concentration of 0.01% can
completely inhibit PCR reactions, while 0.005% can significantly reduce yield.
Phenol : Organic solvent capable of denaturing enzyme proteins. A
concentration of 0.5% can completely inhibit PCR reactions, while 0.2% can
significantly reduce yield. Ethanol : Organic solvent; concentrations greater
than 1% can inhibit PCR reactions. Isopropanol: Organic solvent slightly
stronger in inhibiting PCR reactions compared to ethanol. Sodium Acetate
(NaAc) : Inhibits PCR reactions at concentrations greater than 5mM. Causes a
decrease in reaction system pH, forming sodium salt complexes with DNA,
leading to precipitation. Sodium Chloride : Inhibits PCR reactions at
concentrations greater than 25mM. EDTA : Metal ion chelator capable of
chelating Mg2+ in the system, inhibiting polymerase activity. A concentration
of 0.5mM reduces PCR product yield, while 1mM completely abolishes PCR
product. Hematin : Hematin is a heme pigment found in higher animals, serving
as the prosthetic group of hemoglobin, present in the color proteins of the
blood, liver, and muscles of higher animals. Inhibits PCR reactions at
concentrations greater than 1mg/ml. Difficult to remove with organic solvent
extraction of DNA, leading to easy residue. Hemin Chloride : Hemin chloride is
hematin's central ion, divalent iron ion, which, in the presence of oxidants
and heating, can be oxidized to trivalent iron ion, forming brown hemin
chloride. Inhibits PCR reactions at concentrations greater than 0.1ng/μl.
Tannic Acid : Tannic acid, also known as tannin acid, is a natural phenolic
organic compound found in plants. Inhibits PCR reactions at concentrations
greater than 0.1ng/μl. Heparin : Inhibits PCR reactions at concentrations
greater than 0.15 IU/ml. Heparin, composed of sulfated D-glucosamine and
D-glucuronic acid, is a viscous polysaccharide containing various sulfate
groups, exhibiting strong acidity. Heparin, associated with its anions, is
related to anticoagulation and thus is a polyionic glycosaminoglycan drug. It
also exists in tissues such as the lungs, vascular walls, and intestinal
mucosa, serving as a natural anticoagulant in animals. Heparin strongly
inhibits MLV reverse transcriptase and Taq DNA polymerase. During nucleic acid
purification, heparin in the sample can bind to DNA and RNA, and subsequent
steps cannot remove this interfering effect of heparin. Urea : Derived from
urine, urea is an organic compound composed of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and
hydrogen. Inhibits PCR at concentrations greater than 20mM. Urea is the final
product of protein metabolism in the body, primarily excreted via filtration
by the kidneys into urine. Humic Acid : Derived from soil, plant materials,
and natural water sources. It may inhibit polymerase activity through
chelation of Mg2+. Humic acid is an organic substance formed by microbial
decomposition of dead matter in the soil, typically black-brown in color,
containing elements necessary for plant growth and development, thus improving
fertility. It constitutes a major part of soil organic matter, typically
accounting for 50-70% of total organic matter. Major elements in humic acid
include carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, etc. Humic
acid is not a single compound but rather a mixture of organic compounds with
commonalities and differences in composition, structure, and properties,
primarily consisting of humic and fulvic acids. Bile Salts : Found in feces.
Bile salts, also known as bile acids, are amphipathic macromolecules derived
from cholesterol in bile, aiding in the digestion and absorption of
cholesterol and fats, leading to elevated blood lipid levels. Bile salts
effectively break down fat tissues and proteins, facilitating the faster
breakdown, absorption, and utilization of these nutrients in the small
intestine. Bilirubin : Bilirubin is a type of bile pigment, the primary
pigment in human bile. It is the major metabolic product of heme compounds in
the body, toxic and capable of irreversible damage to the brain and nervous
system, yet it also functions as an antioxidant, inhibiting the oxidation of
linoleic acid and phospholipids. Bilirubin serves as a critical indicator of
jaundice and liver function clinically. Bilirubin can inhibit Taq enzyme
activity. Hemoglobin : Hemoglobin and its metabolites may interact with Taq
enzyme, inhibiting Taq enzyme activity and significantly reducing PCR
amplification efficiency. This inhibitory effect may be related to the release
of iron ions. Hyperlipidemia : High levels of lipids inhibit Taq enzyme
activity, resulting in reduced amplification efficiency. The interference
mechanism of hyperlipidemia in Real-Time PCR mainly involves the shielding or
absorption of fluorescence by low-density lipoproteins in the blood.
Hyperlipidemia leads to fluorescence quenching, resulting in decreased
fluorescence signal intensity. Studies have shown that the use of low-
temperature high-speed centrifugation can effectively remove interference from
lipemic factors. IgG : The mechanism by which IgG inhibits PCR reactions
involves interaction with single-stranded DNA, preventing target DNA from
binding to DNA polymerase. Moreover, this inhibitory effect is enhanced during
sample heating cycles. Sodium cholate, deoxycholate, taurocholate, iron
chloride, plant complex polysaccharides, melanin, calcium ions, collagen, etc.
PCR Enhancers PCR enhancers are a type of additive that can improve the
sensitivity, specificity, fidelity, and other properties of PCR and PCR-
related techniques. Examples include betaine, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),
formamide, glycerol, PEG, spermine, and single-stranded DNA binding proteins.
However, at high concentrations, they can also inhibit PCR. According to their
functions and principles, they can be roughly divided into three categories:
1\. Used for amplifying templates with high GC content or complex secondary
structures : 1M betaine, 1-10% DMSO, 1-5% formamide, and 1-10% glycerol can
significantly increase the yield for such templates, but excess amounts can
inhibit PCR reactions. Betaine : Betaine, chemically known as
N,N,N-trimethylglycine, is a biogenic amine similar in structure to amino
acids and belongs to the quaternary ammonium compound category. Betaine is
widely present in both animals and plants. Betaine has the ability to disrupt
DNA sequences rich in GC content, improving the yield and specificity of PCR
amplification. Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) : DMSO is a sulfur-containing organic
compound with weak basicity, soluble in both water and organic solvents,
commonly used as an organic solvent. Pure DMSO has a freezing point of
18.45°C, while DMSO with 40% water content does not freeze at -60°C, and when
mixed with water or snow, DMSO generates heat. Therefore, it provides
convenience for making antifreeze for automobiles, brake fluid, and hydraulic
fluid components. 2\. Used to protect the activity and stability of DNA
polymerase In some reactions, additives such as 0.1mg/ml BSA, 0.1-10% gelatin,
or non-ionic detergents can enhance the stability of polymerase and reduce
adsorption of reagents to tube walls. BSA can resist the inhibitory effects of
hemoglobin, melanin, etc. Non-ionic detergents such as Tween-20, NP-40,
TritonX-100 can counteract the inhibitory effects of trace amounts of strong
ionic detergents, such as 0.01% SDS. Trehalose : Trehalose, also known as
mycose, is a non-reducing disaccharide composed of two glucose molecules. It
forms a special protective membrane on the surface of cells under harsh
conditions such as high temperature, extreme cold, or dehydration, effectively
protecting the structure of biomolecules and maintaining the life processes
and biological characteristics of organisms. Trehalose has thermal stability
and heat-activation properties. It can maintain the protein skeleton during
protein denaturation and preserve its natural structure. It has been verified
in various enzymatic reactions in molecular biology, such as cDNA synthesis
involving reverse transcriptase, DNA degradation involving Dnase I, and
restriction enzyme cleavage reactions. Functions: Acts as a PCR enhancer by
lowering the DNA double-stranded melting temperature, maintaining the
stability of Taq DNA polymerase, and improving PCR reaction efficiency.
Neutralizes the inhibitory effects of inhibitors on DNA polymerase,
maintaining PCR amplification efficiency. Acts as an additive in SYBR Green I
real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR, effectively reducing the inhibition
of SYBR Green I on PCR. Acts as a preservative for rare sample genomes or
genomes at very low concentrations. Applications: Acts as an enzyme
stabilizer, maintaining enzyme activity and post-heat activation enzyme
activity. Can be applied in DNA sequencing reaction experiments to enhance the
accuracy of sequencing containing repetitive sequences (multiple consecutive
A's or T's). PCR amplification of complex templates, such as samples with high
GC content. Suitable for reverse transcription reactions of relatively long
cDNA, especially the synthesis of full-length cDNA, to improve library
coverage. Preservative for trace DNA samples. Additive for qRT-PCR reaction
systems to improve reaction performance. BSA and Tween-20 : Trehalose, BSA,
and Tween-20 have anti-inhibitory effects on shrimp shell components and are
commonly used in PCR methods for detecting viruses in shrimp samples.
Additionally, BSA can enhance the resistance of rTth enzyme to biological
samples, and BSA has a high lysine content, which can bind to phenolic
compounds remaining in the nucleic acid extraction process, protecting Taq DNA
polymerase activity and thereby enhancing PCR amplification efficiency. PEG600
and Glycerol : PEG600 and glycerol can increase PCR product yield by enhancing
enzyme thermal stability and protecting enzyme activity. 3\. Used to optimize
primer and template binding The addition of ammonium ions can reduce
mismatches between primers and templates, improving reaction specificity, thus
reducing the requirements for reaction conditions. Therefore, many PCR
reagents contain 10-20mM ammonium sulfate. Tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC)
also plays a similar role. Spermine : Spermine, also known as
tris(aminopropyl)amine hydrochloride, is a polyamine. It is widely distributed
in organisms and is biosynthesized from putrescine (butanediamine) and
S-adenosylmethionine. Spermine can inhibit neuronal synthetase, bind and
precipitate DNA, be used for DNA-binding protein purification, and stimulate
T4 polynucleotide kinase activity. Research has shown that spermine exhibits
significant inhibitory effects on bile salts, urea, and hematin. Spermine
enhances PCR, primarily by promoting the formation of PCR initiation complexes
through promoting the binding of polymerase, primers, and templates.
Micromolar concentrations of spermine significantly enhance the amplification
of plant genomic DNA. Ammonium Sulfate : Ammonium sulfate can optimize the
specific binding of primers to templates, improving PCR specificity. Research
results show that ammonium sulfate has a significant anti-urea inhibitory
effect. 4\. Sources and Mechanisms of PCR Inhibitors in Specimens Endogenous
Sources : Naturally occurring components present in specimens, such as
immunoglobulins, proteases, hemoglobin and its metabolites, lactoferrin in
leukocytes, myoglobin, lipids, mucins, ions, bile salts, polysaccharides, etc.
Exogenous Sources : Inhibitors present in specimen containers or sampling
equipment, such as heparin anticoagulants, glove powder, etc. 1\. Mechanisms
of Inhibition : Interference with cell lysis during nucleic acid extraction :
Incomplete cell lysis leads to inefficient release of nucleic acids,
preventing amplification. For instance, DNA released by boiling methods may
not always fully dissociate from structural or DNA-binding proteins, resulting
in inhibitory effects on amplification. Degradation or encapsulation of
nucleic acids : DNA instability at the primary structure level due to
hydrolysis, non-enzymatic methylation, oxidative damage, and enzymatic
degradation. Nucleases present in cells can degrade nucleic acids. Residual
nucleases in nucleic acid samples can lead to nucleic acid degradation.
Restriction endonucleases produced by microbes are also factors in DNA
degradation. Some bacterial DNAases are heat-stable nucleases, which can
hydrolyze genomic and primer DNA during mid-amplification. Nucleic acids and
primers may fail to amplify due to their inability to bind to DNA polymerase.
Inhibitory effects of proteins, polysaccharides, cell debris, lipids, etc., on
PCR are likely due to their physical encapsulation of DNA, preventing its
contact with the polymerase. The impact of talcum powder on PCR amplification
on latex gloves may be due to its non-specific binding to DNA. Because DNA can
bind to glass, silica, etc., this is also the basic principle of nucleic acid
extraction using silica adsorption methods. Inactivation of heat-stable DNA
polymerase . 2\. Clinical PCR inhibitors : total bilirubin, hemoglobin, IgG,
triglycerides, and heparin. These substances originate from sample components
or processes and can reduce the efficiency of template amplification, leading
to false-negative results in the detection of low-level samples. 3\. Reverse
transcription inhibitors : SDS, EDTA, glycerol, sodium pyrophosphate,
spermine, and guanidinium salts. Washing RNA precipitates with 70% (v/v)
ethanol can remove inhibitors. In conclusion, understanding and controlling
both internal and external factors influencing PCR reactions are crucial for
obtaining reliable results in molecular biology experiments. By adhering to
principles of primer design, ensuring primer and enzyme quality, optimizing
reaction conditions, and mitigating the effects of inhibitors, researchers can
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of PCR-based assays. At SBS Genetech , we

Return to site Exploring the Differences Between AMV RT and MMLV RT in
Molecular Biology Delve into the world of molecular biology as we unravel the
differences between AMV RT and MMLV RT, crucial enzymes in cDNA synthesis
March 26, 2024 · RNA-Related In the realm of molecular biology, the conversion
of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) is a fundamental process, often
facilitated by reverse transcriptase enzymes. Among the commonly used enzymes
for this purpose are AMV RT (Avian Myeloblastosis Virus Reverse Transcriptase)
and MMLV RT (Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase). While both
enzymes share the overarching goal of cDNA synthesis, they exhibit notable
differences that warrant exploration. Source and Origin: AMV RT hails from the
Avian Myeloblastosis Virus, while MMLV RT finds its origin in the Moloney
Murine Leukemia Virus. These viral sources provide the enzymes with their
catalytic properties and define their characteristics. Thermostability: One
significant discrepancy lies in thermostability. MMLV RT boasts higher
resilience to temperature fluctuations compared to its counterpart, AMV RT.
This attribute is crucial in experimental setups where maintaining enzyme
activity at elevated temperatures is imperative. Processivity: Processivity,
the enzyme's ability to remain attached to the template nucleic acid strand
during synthesis, differs between the two. MMLV RT tends to exhibit higher
processivity, enabling efficient cDNA synthesis, particularly for longer RNA
templates. Temperature Optima: Each enzyme harbors distinct optimal
temperature ranges for activity. AMV RT generally operates optimally at higher
temperatures than MMLV RT. This variance in temperature preference can
influence experimental conditions and outcomes. Ribonuclease H Activity: MMLV
RT uniquely possesses inherent ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity, allowing it
to degrade the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA hybrid molecule during cDNA synthesis.
This feature aids in the removal of the RNA template post-synthesis, which can
be advantageous in certain experimental contexts. Sensitivity to Inhibitors:
AMV RT and MMLV RT exhibit disparate sensitivities to inhibitors or
contaminants present in the reaction mixture. AMV RT tends to be more
susceptible to inhibition, potentially affecting reaction efficiency and
reliability. In summary, while AMV RT and MMLV RT serve analogous functions in
reverse transcription, their differences in thermostability, processivity,
temperature optima, RNase H activity, and sensitivity to inhibitors underscore
the need for thoughtful enzyme selection in molecular biology experiments.
Researchers must weigh these distinctions against their experimental
requirements to ensure optimal outcomes in cDNA synthesis and downstream
applications. Why Choose SBS Genetech's Mutant M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase?

Explore the intricacies of M-MLV reverse transcriptase error rates and their
implications in molecular biology experiments August 3, 2022 · RNA-Related
Reverse transcriptases are essential enzymes used in molecular biology to
convert RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA), a crucial step in various
applications such as gene expression analysis, cloning, and sequencing. One
commonly used reverse transcriptase is derived from the Moloney Murine
Leukemia Virus (M-MLV). Understanding its error rate is fundamental for
accurate interpretation of experimental results and designing reliable assays.
Factors Influencing Error Rate The error rate of M-MLV reverse transcriptase
can vary due to several factors: Reaction Conditions: Variables such as
temperature, buffer composition, and presence of co-factors can influence the
fidelity of the enzyme. RNA Template: The sequence and structure of the RNA
template being reverse transcribed can affect the likelihood of errors during
cDNA synthesis. Length of Synthesized cDNA: Longer cDNA molecules may be more
prone to errors due to increased chances of misincorporation or slippage
during synthesis. Estimated Error Rate The error rate of M-MLV reverse
transcriptase is commonly estimated to range from approximately 1 in 10^4 to
10^5 nucleotides incorporated. This means that, on average, one error occurs
per several thousand bases transcribed. However, it's important to recognize
that this is a rough estimate and actual error rates can vary based on
experimental conditions and specific RNA targets. Implications and
Considerations Understanding the error rate of M-MLV reverse transcriptase is
crucial for various applications: Gene Expression Analysis: In quantitative
reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and RNA sequencing experiments, accurate
measurement of gene expression levels relies on faithful cDNA synthesis.
Errors introduced during reverse transcription can lead to misinterpretation
of expression profiles. Cloning and Mutagenesis: Errors in cDNA synthesis can
result in the introduction of mutations, affecting downstream applications
such as cloning or site-directed mutagenesis. Careful consideration of error
rates is necessary to minimize unintended mutations. Evolutionary Studies:
Studies investigating RNA viruses or RNA-based evolutionary processes rely on
reverse transcription for genomic analysis. Understanding error rates provides
insights into the evolutionary dynamics and adaptation of these organisms.
Conclusion M-MLV reverse transcriptase is a versatile enzyme widely used in
molecular biology applications. Its error rate, although relatively low
compared to some polymerases, remains a critical consideration for the
accuracy and reliability of experimental results. Researchers must be aware of
the factors influencing error rates and employ appropriate controls and
validation strategies to mitigate potential errors and ensure robust data
interpretation. Continuing research into enzyme engineering and optimization
may further enhance the fidelity of reverse transcription techniques,
advancing our understanding of RNA biology and its applications. Why Choose

Return to site Understanding the Active Sites of MMLV Reverse Transcriptase
Dive into the molecular orchestra of MMLV Reverse Transcriptase as we dissect
its active sites, crucial for converting RNA to DNA June 15, 2022 · RNA-
Related Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) Reverse Transcriptase stands as a
pivotal enzyme in molecular biology, particularly in the realm of nucleic acid
research. Its remarkable ability to catalyze the conversion of single-stranded
RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) has made it an indispensable tool in various
experimental techniques like reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and cDNA library construction. At the heart of MMLV reverse
transcriptase's functionality lie its active sites, each playing a crucial
role in the intricate process of reverse transcription. RNA-dependent DNA
Polymerase Activity Site Central to the reverse transcription process is the
RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity site. Here, MMLV reverse transcriptase
catalyzes the synthesis of a complementary DNA strand using an RNA template as
a guide. This site facilitates the polymerization of deoxyribonucleotides,
mirroring the sequence encoded in the RNA molecule. Through this activity,
MMLV reverse transcriptase enables the conversion of RNA into DNA, a
fundamental step in numerous molecular biology applications. Ribonuclease H
(RNase H) Activity Site Adjacent to the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity
site lies the Ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity site. RNase H plays a critical
role in the removal of the RNA template strand once its sequence has been
copied into cDNA. This enzymatic activity hydrolyzes the RNA strand of the
RNA-DNA hybrid molecule, leaving behind a single-stranded DNA molecule. The
action of RNase H is essential for the progression of reverse transcription,
as it clears the way for the subsequent steps in cDNA synthesis. DNA-dependent
DNA Polymerase Activity Site Completing the ensemble of active sites is the
DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity site. Although primarily recognized for
its RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, MMLV reverse transcriptase also
exhibits DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. This activity comes into play
during the later stages of reverse transcription when gaps are generated in
the newly synthesized DNA strand following the removal of the RNA template by
RNase H. The DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity fills in these gaps,
facilitating the synthesis of the complementary DNA strand and culminating in
the formation of a double-stranded DNA molecule. Conclusion In summary, the
active sites of MMLV reverse transcriptase orchestrate a finely tuned
enzymatic symphony, driving the complex process of reverse transcription with
precision. From the initiation of cDNA synthesis guided by the RNA template to
the removal of the RNA strand by RNase H and the subsequent filling of gaps by
DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, each active site plays a distinct yet
interdependent role in facilitating the conversion of RNA into functional DNA.
Understanding the intricacies of these active sites not only sheds light on
the molecular mechanisms underlying reverse transcription but also underscores
the invaluable utility of MMLV reverse transcriptase in molecular biology
research and biotechnological applications. Why Choose SBS Genetech's Mutant

can effectively reduce the viscosity of protein samples, remove the
contamination of nucleic acid in protein samples, and has no residual protease
activity. The nuclease activity reaches 1 * 10 6 U/mg protein. Broadonase
nuclease also has many other applications, such as reducing sample processing
time, increasing protein yield, more complete precipitation and supernatant
separation during centrifugation, more convenient centrifugation of solution
(especially ultrafiltration), and improving the efficiency of chromatographic
purification. Our Broadonase nuclease includes four types: Broadonase nuclease
without any label, endotoxin-free Broadonase nuclease, Strep tagII Broadonase
nuclease, and endotoxin-free Strep tagII Broadonase nuclease, which can meet
the needs of different downstream applications. Among them, Strep tagII
Broadonase nuclease can be efficiently removed by Strep Tactin XT Resin after
digestion of nucleic acid. And endotoxin-free Broadonase nucleases, with
endotoxin content < 40 EU/mL (calculated by unit conversion amount as
endotoxin <0.15 EU per 1000U), can be applied to the development and
production of medicinal grade. In addition, the nuclease residue can be
evaluated by Broadonase residue detection kit based on fluorescent probe, and
the detection can be completed in 15 minutes, with a minimum of 2 ng/ml of
nuclease residue detectable. Unit Definition The amount of enzyme that reduced
the value of △A260 by 1.0 (equivalent to the complete digestion of 37 μg DNA)
within 30 minutes under the reaction conditions of 37℃ and pH 8.0 is defined
as an active unit. Note: Crude products containing a large amount of protein,
cell wall, and other salts can partly inhibit the activity of the enzyme, and
the amount of the enzyme needs to be increased when used. Application Removal
of nucleic acid contamination during protein extraction: Broadonase nuclease
can effectively reduce sample viscosity and facilitate downstream operation
when purifying recombinant protein or extracting protein from tissue cell
samples Use with cell or bacterial lysate to remove nucleic acid from crude
extract, reduce solution viscosity and increase protein yield Reduction of
clotting of stored peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) Degradation of nucleic
acids to facilitate the preparation of high-quality inclusion bodies before
renaturation of insoluble proteins Effective removal of negatively charged
nucleic acids on bidirectional SDS-PAGE protein samples improves protein
separation and enhances 2-DE resolution Removal of DNA Contamination in
Vaccine and Virus Sample Preparation Compatibility Broadonase nuclease has
high stability and digestive nucleic acid activity under very broad
conditions, which makes them compatible with a variety of cell lysates and
protein extraction reagents containing a variety of ionic and nonionic
detergents, reductants, etc. For example, 1 mM EDTA partially inhibits
Broadonase activity, 5 mM EDTA loses 90% of activity, and 1 mM PMSF does not
inhibit nuclease activity. < 0.4% Triton® X-100 has almost no effect on
nuclease activity. <0.4% sodium deoxycholate can maintain 70% nuclease
activity, but after exceeding this threshold, nuclease activity will decrease
sharply, and 1% concentration will reduce 70%. 0.05% SDS has almost no effect
on nuclease activity, while SDS concentration between 0.1% and 1% will
decrease nuclease activity sharply after denaturation. Increasing the amount
of nuclease can compensate for activity. In addition, the nuclease can
tolerate 6M urea. When the urea concentration reaches 7M, the activity of the
nuclease decreases sharply after denaturation, which can also be compensated
by increasing the amount of nuclease. Removal of Broadonase For Strep tag II
Broadonase, the removal rate is >95% by Strep-Tactin XT Resin. For untagged
Broadonase nuclease, the nuclease can be removed by chromatographic
purification, and then Broadonase Detection Kit can be used to detect the
remaining nuclease. Common chromatographic purification methods include cation
exchange media and anion exchange media. Storage The minimum shelf life is 2

Endonuclease IV, also known as Nfo, is derived from E.Coli , involved in DNA
damage repair. The enzyme can recognize the AP site (apurinic/apyrimidinic
site) on double-stranded DNA, and cleave the first phosphodiester bond at the
5´ end of the AP site to generate 3´ hydroxyl groups and 5´ deoxyribose
phosphate terminals. In addition, Endonuclease IV also has 3´ diesterase
activity, which can release glyceraldehyde phosphate, complete deoxyribose 5´
- phosphate, and phosphate from the 3´ end of DNA. The enzyme also has 3´- 5´
exonuclease activity. The gradual action of the enzyme on the substrate is
affected by metal ions, DTT, EDTA, etc., and is more likely to act on double-
stranded DNA at the 3´ concave end. Component Endonuclease IV (10 U/μl): 100

Description Exonuclease III was derived from E.coli , with 3 '- 5' exonuclease
activity, acts on double-stranded DNA, and gradually cuts single nucleotides
from the 3 'OH terminal direction. Each time the enzyme binds to the substrate
for catalysis, only a few nucleotides are removed, resulting in progressive
deletion within the DNA molecule group. The best substrate of this enzyme is
the flat end or 5' protruding end double-stranded DNA molecule, but it can
also act on the notch of double-stranded DNA, degrading DNA molecules from 3',
and releasing 5' single nucleotides. For the 3' protruding end, especially
those more than 4nt, it almost does not cut at all, nor can it cut the
thiophosphoryl lipid bond. The activity of Exonuclease III depends partly on

Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification vs PCR - Isother... Return to site
Return to site Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification vs PCR Discover the
fundamental differences between Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP)
and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), including mechanisms, temperature
requirements, and sensitivities February 8, 2024 · Isothermal Amp Loop-
mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
are both methods used for the amplification of DNA, but they differ in their
mechanisms, requirements, and applications. Mechanism: PCR: PCR involves
cycling through different temperatures (denaturation, annealing, and
extension) to amplify specific DNA sequences. It requires a thermal cycler to
control these temperature changes. LAMP: LAMP is an isothermal amplification
technique, meaning it can amplify DNA at a constant temperature, usually
around 60-65°C. LAMP relies on a strand-displacing DNA polymerase and a set of
four to six primers that recognize six to eight distinct regions on the target
DNA sequence. LAMP produces a mixture of stem-loop DNA structures, resulting
in amplification of the target DNA. Temperature Requirement: PCR: Requires
cycling through different temperature steps (typically 95°C for denaturation,
50-65°C for annealing, and 72°C for extension). LAMP: Operates consistently at
a steady temperature, usually within the range of 60-65°C. However, with our
exclusive Premium LAMP amplification (pLAMP) system , this temperature can be
elevated to 70°C, offering distinct advantages. This higher temperature
setting notably diminishes primer dimer formation , enhances amplification
specificity , and ensures more effective release of nucleic acids from crude
samples . Time: PCR: Typically takes around 2-3 hours to complete a reaction,
including the time needed for cycling through different temperature steps.
LAMP: Typically achieves faster results compared to PCR, often concluding
within 30-60 minutes owing to its isothermal nature. With our meticulously
optimized reaction system , this timeframe can be further reduced to as little
as 20 minutes . Equipment: PCR: Requires a thermal cycler to control
temperature changes. LAMP: Can be performed with simpler equipment, such as a
water bath or a heating block, as it operates at a constant temperature.
Specificity: PCR: High specificity due to the requirement for specific primer
annealing. LAMP: Demonstrates remarkable specificity, utilizing multiple
primers targeting distinct regions of the DNA sequence. Through the
integration of helicase, our Premium LAMP amplification (pLAMP) system
eliminates the necessity for F3/B3 primers . Additionally, helicase aids in
strand unwinding, thereby decreasing the concentration of FIP/BIP primers .
This dual function effectively minimizes non-specific amplification , ensuring
superior amplification uniformity. Sensitivity: PCR: PCR is highly sensitive
and can detect low levels of target DNA. LAMP: LAMP is also highly sensitive
and can detect small amounts of target DNA, sometimes even without the need
for DNA purification. Applications: PCR: Widely used in molecular biology
research, clinical diagnostics, forensics, and many other fields. LAMP:
Increasingly used in point-of-care diagnostics, field testing, and resource-
limited settings due to its simplicity, rapidity, and minimal equipment
requirements. In summary, while both PCR and LAMP serve as valuable DNA
amplification techniques, LAMP stands out for its speed, simplicity, and
minimal equipment needs. The Premium LAMP amplification (pLAMP) system
enhances specificity and reduces reaction time even further, rendering it
especially ideal for applications such as point-of-care diagnostics and field
testing. At SBS Genetech , our pioneering spirit drives us to continually
enhance our offerings in l oop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)

Integrity Strategies to Combat the Invisible Culprit Threatening Nucleic Acid
Analysis February 17, 2024 · PCR-Related Ever found yourself scratching your
head over mysterious target bands in the blank control of your conventional
PCR? Or perhaps pondering the appearance of Ct values in your qPCR
experiments' no-template controls (NTC)? Maybe you've experienced a
frustrating bout of contaminated results despite replacing reagents and
samples multiple times. If so, you're not alone. Many molecular biology
laboratories grappling with PCR and qPCR have encountered such confounding
situations. But fear not, it's not necessarily a flaw in your reagents or
enzymes. The likely culprit? Aerosol contamination! You might think aerosol
contamination isn't a big deal for nucleic acid experiments, but historically,
major nucleic acid contamination incidents have had serious consequences. On
April 18, 2020, The Washington Post broke a major story: contamination issues
in the laboratories of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
led to a delay in the rapid development of testing tools for the novel
coronavirus, causing delays in COVID-19 testing nationwide. Reports indicated
that after the CDC distributed test kits to 26 public health laboratories
across the U.S., 24 of them reported "false-positive" results, prompting
concerns about the test kits. It took CDC officials over a month to resolve
the testing issues, exacerbating delays in the production and distribution of
test kits across the country. Clearly, aerosol contamination can have serious
and sometimes uncontrollable consequences for nucleic acid testing
experiments. This is especially true for highly sensitive nucleic acid
detection assays like RT-qPCR, where even slight contamination can affect the
accuracy of results. So, what exactly is aerosol contamination, and how does
it affect PCR experiments? Aerosol contamination refers to the dispersion and
suspension of solid or liquid particles in a gas medium, potentially including
biological agents like bacteria or viruses. In laboratories where sensitive
nucleic acid detection assays like RT-qPCR are commonplace, aerosol
contamination poses a significant threat to the accuracy of results. Even
minor contamination can skew Ct values, leading to erroneous assessments of
gene content in samples. But how does aerosol contamination occur in the first
place? Friction between gases and liquids can generate aerosols, and in busy
labs where multiple individuals handle the same reagents and equipment, the
risk of contamination skyrockets. For instance, using shared equipment like
pipettes and centrifuges, conducting PCR procedures in close proximity, or
even simply mixing samples in the same area can introduce contaminants. This
can manifest as false positives in blank controls during gel electrophoresis
or unexpected bands in qPCR assays. So, how can laboratories mitigate the risk
of aerosol contamination? Utilize UDG contamination prevention reagents :
Aerosols may harbor copy numbers ranging from 10^4 to 10^6 copies. Hence, even
minute traces of contamination can potentially yield false-positive outcomes
in experiments. Nevertheless, by employing a qPCR premix equipped with a UDG
contamination prevention system, such as Probe qPCR Mix (2X, UDG) , the
likelihood of contamination stemming from your amplification products can be
greatly mitigated. Implement standard laboratory layout setups : Many
laboratories often perform fluorescence quantitative detection experiments
without adequately considering the necessity for proper nucleic acid
amplification area divisions. A well-thought-out laboratory layout can
significantly decrease the risk of nucleic acid contamination. Essentially, a
testing laboratory should incorporate the following designated areas: a
reagent storage and preparation area, a sample preparation area, and an
amplification and product analysis area, each physically separated from one
another. Pass-through windows should adhere to sealing standards and must
prevent direct airflow between areas. Enforce unidirectional flow for
personnel and items : In theory, the movement of personnel and materials
should adhere to a unidirectional flow, starting from the reagent storage and
preparation area, through the sample preparation area, amplification area, and
finally to the product analysis area. This arrangement minimizes the potential
for sample cross-contamination. However, in crowded laboratory settings unable
to maintain this ideal flow, instruments and consumables such as pipettes,
centrifuges, nucleic acid extractors, PCR machines, opened reagent boxes, and
tip boxes require regular treatment with nucleic acid decontaminants to
eradicate any residual nucleic acid contamination. Adopt standardized storage
practices : To mitigate the risk of reagents being opened repeatedly,
potentially leading to contamination with the genes under examination and
compromising the efficacy of subsequent reagent use, it's advisable to divide
reagents into smaller aliquots for storage. This practice minimizes the
likelihood of aerosol contamination resulting from frequent reagent openings.
Particularly for positive samples, ensuring tight sealing of caps is crucial,
thereby reducing the possibility of sample exposure to the environment.
Standardize experimental procedures : PCR products undergo multiple rounds of
amplification, resulting in copy numbers far exceeding the detection limit of
PCR. Therefore, during operations, movements should be slow and gentle to
minimize the risk of aerosol contamination. When aspirating samples using a
pipette, it's imperative to strictly adhere to the principle of slow
aspiration and slow dispensing. After centrifuging to mix samples, it's
advisable to wait a moment before opening the lid to prevent the gas in the
reaction tube from carrying sample genes into the air. Prior to gel
electrophoresis after PCR, if there are indications of loosened caps on the
reaction tubes within the strip or if the liquid level in the tubes decreases
post-PCR, it's crucial to recognize that cross-contamination may have occurred
between tubes or within the PCR machine itself. This scenario often manifests
in reaction tubes positioned near the edges of the strip. The aforementioned
sources of nucleic acid contamination can all contribute to the dispersion of
aerosols into the air or direct adsorption onto surfaces. Heavy contamination
may yield false-positive Ct values around 24, while moderate contamination
could lead to values around 30, and light contamination may result in values
around 33. Therefore, rather than attributing blame solely to reagents, it is
imperative to concentrate on minimizing aerosol contamination to guarantee
precise and dependable outcomes in our PCR endeavors! Subscribe Previous

Return to site Congratulations to Our Customer for Published in Advanced
Materials (IF: 32)! This study presents a new nanocarrier, Cellular Membrane-
Engineered Nanovesicle (CMEV), for treating ischemic cardiomyopathy. CMEV
targets lesions with neutrophil-like migration, accumulates using an embedded
antibody, and releases a therapeutic peptide (CST) to enhance cardiac
function. August 27, 2023 · Publications, News On August 17 th , a research
paper entitled " Cellular Membrane-Engineered Nanovesicles as Three-Stage
Booster to Target Lesion Core " was published in the prestigious academic
journal Advanced Materials (impact factor: 32.086) by collaborated research
group led by Professor Wei Jin, Professor Wenguo Cui and Professor Ke Yang
from the School of Medicine at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. This study
introduces a novel nanocarrier, the Cellular Membrane-Engineered Nanovesicle
(CMEV), for the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy. This nanocarrier is
constructed using a double emulsion-extrusion method and has a hierarchical
structure, integrating a neutrophil membrane, functional antibody, and gelled
drug-loaded core as a 'three-stage booster' to target the lesion core and
deliver Catestatin (CST), a small therapeutic peptide. By coating the shell
with a neutrophil membrane, the CMEV is endowed with the function of
neutrophil-like migration to achieve the first stage of tissue targeting.
Based on specific anchoring to injured myocardium, the Myosin Light Chain 3
(MLC3) antibody was embedded to fulfill the second stage of CMEV accumulation
in the lesion core. The gelled core containing CST-sodium alginate (NaAlg)
with a pH-responsive shell is prepared by ionic cross-linking to accomplish
the third stage of precise CST administration. Triggered by the
microenvironment, NaAlg electrostatically adheres to the lesion core for
sustained release, enhancing the efficacy of CST in improving cardiomyocyte
apoptosis, excessive fibrosis, macrophage polarization, and angiogenesis.
Thus, the "three-stage booster" nanovesicle significantly ameliorates cardiac
function and adverse remodeling to treat ischemic cardiomyopathy. This
research provides a novel and effective approach for treating ischemic
cardiomyopathy. https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202302801 In this research study,
aqueous CST (6 mg/mL) is synthesized by SBS Genetech Co., Ltd.. Since 2000,

Cas14aLyo-1k (for 1000pmol) Description Cas14a1 is a type of endonuclease that
acts as a restriction enzyme, specifically binding and cleaving target single-
stranded DNA (ssDNA) under the guidance of tracrRNA:crRNA (or sgRNA), and it
does not require a PAM site. Compared to other Cas proteins, Cas14 proteins
generally have a smaller molecular weight (400-700aa). Similar to Cas12,
Cas14a1 can bind to target nucleic acids and activate its ssDNA endonuclease
activity, making it applicable for molecular detection of target nucleic
acids. Unlike Cas12, Cas14a1 can only bind to ssDNA targets. Therefore, target
nucleic acids that have undergone amplification enrichment need to be treated
with T7 endonuclease, and one of the amplification primers needs to be
phosphorothioate-modified to ensure that T7 endonuclease cleaves only one
strand, leaving the ssDNA target strand for Cas14a1-mediated molecular
detection. The lyophilized version of Cas14a1 can be transported at room
temperature, saving the high cost of dry ice transportation. Transportation
Both Cas14a1 and 10×Buffer can be transported at room temperature. Storage The
minimum shelf life is 18 months at 2-28°C for Cas14a1 and 1 year at -20°C for
10×Buffer. Instruction: Protocol SBS Genetech is recognized as one of the
global major leading industry players in Gene Editing by third-party market

$600.00 - $2,000.00 Extreme Thermostable RNase HII is an endogenous
endonuclease derived from extremely thermostable strains. It recognizes
RNA/DNA hybrid strands and cleaves RNA strands. It has very low cleavage
activity to single-stranded RNA and has no cleavage activity to dsDNA and
ssDNA. The RNase HII enzyme cleaves from the 5' end of the single
ribonucleotide residue of DNA/RNA duplex to produce a 5' - terminal phosphate
group and a 3 '- terminal hydroxyl group. The RNase HII enzyme has the best
activity at 70-75°C and is active at 50°C to 75°C, but its activity is very
low at room temperature (activity is reduced by~1000 times). The enzyme is
extremely heat-resistant and retains all its activity after being heated at
95°C for 15 minutes. Therefore, it is compatible with most PCR buffer systems
and can be used in RNase HII dependent PCR (rhPCR) and other experiments.
Compared with Rnase HI, Rnase HII can recognize and cut single
ribonucleotides, while RNase HI recognizes 2 '- OH of four consecutive
ribonucleotides; In addition, Rnase HII can degrade Okazaki fragments, while
RNase HI has no such activity. Select Select 200U 1KU Quantity Coming soon Add

reaction SNP detection and rare allele detection Differentiate heterologous
genes Improve the accuracy of multiplex PCR products Storage The minimum shelf
life is 3 years at -20°C. Note When this enzyme is used in rhPCR (RHase HII
dependent PCR), it needs to use a DNA primer with a 3' end closure group. The
enzyme is active at 50-75°C, and its dosage can be adjusted according to
different applications. The enzyme is compatible with most PCR buffer systems
and has broad requirements for Mg 2+ concentration. It can play an active role
between 1~6 mM. The enzyme is extremely heat-resistant, and its activity does
not decrease significantly at 95°C for 15 minutes, so it cannot be inactivated
by heat, but can be inactivated by 0.1% SDS. Related: RNase H Thermostable

Glycosylase is a recombinant protein expressed by E. coli, which can be used
to achieve general, site-specific, or strand-specific U-DNA cleavage depending
on how the DNA is prepared. This enzyme shows lower thermostability and is,
therefore, easier to inactivate. Select Select 500U 5,000U Quantity Coming

flexibility of our product offerings, now available in a glycerol-free
version, meticulously crafted to seamlessly integrate with your freeze-drying
systems. Additionally, we present a lyophilized version, a practical solution
ensuring stable transportation at room temperature, thereby notably mitigating

(for 500U) Cat. No.: HLUDG-5k (for 5,000U) For the standard version, please
visit Uracil N-Glycosylase . Description Heat-Labile Uracil DNA Glycosylase
can effectively hydrolyze uracil-glycosidic bonds in single- or double-
stranded DNA, excising uracil and creating alkali-sensitive abasic sites in
the DNA, which can be hydrolyzed by endonuclease, heat, or alkali treatment.
The enzyme has no activity to RNA and is mainly used to prevent contamination
in the PCR reaction system. The uracil DNA glycosylase from E.coli is
relatively heat-resistant, and a small amount of uracil DNA glycosylase
activity remains after being treated at 95°C for 10 min, which leads to the
degradation of PCR products containing dU base. While the HL-UDG from
psychrophilic marine bacteria is completely inactivated at 55°C for 5 min.
Before PCR amplification, HL-UDG is added to the PCR reaction system, and the
contamination in the system could be eliminated at 25°C for 10 min. HL-UDG
will then be inactivated in the first step of denaturation (at 94°C) of the
PCR cycle, preventing the degradation of the synthesized PCR products
containing dU. Unit Definition One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme
required to catalyze the release of 60 pmol uracil from the double-stranded
DNA containing uracil at 37°C per minute. Reaction Buffer HL-UDG is compatible
with most PCR reaction buffers, but its activity is inhibited at high ion
concentrations (> 100 mm). Storage Buffer 20 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM
DTT, , 50% Glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.5. Storage The minimum
shelf life is 2 years at -20°C. Avoid repeated freezing and thawing. Heat

Uracil DNA Glycosylase 2.0 (HL-UDG 2.0) is also available by inquiry, which
can be transported at room temperature. Description UDG enzyme catalyzes the
hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond between uracil bases and the ribose-
phosphate backbone in DNA chains containing uracil, releasing free uracil.
This Uracil DNA Glycosylase (UDG) is derived from the udg gene of a marine
cold-adapted bacterium and is obtained through recombinant expression and
multi-step protein purification. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 25 kDa
and selectively breaks the glycosidic bonds of U bases in single-stranded and
double-stranded DNA, with no activity against RNA. UDG enzyme is commonly used
to prevent cross-contamination of PCR products. Its principle of action is
based on substituting dTTP with dUTP in the PCR reaction, resulting in PCR
products containing dU bases. UDG selectively cleaves the glycosidic bonds of
U bases in single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, degrading the PCR
products, thereby eliminating contamination issues from previous amplification
products in new samples. Heat-Labile Uracil DNA Glycosylase 2.0 (HL-UDG 2.0)

previous HL-UDG , making it ideal for preventing cross-contamination of PCR
products. E. coli UDG, on the other hand, becomes partially active after high-
temperature inactivation, which is not recommended for preventing cross-
contamination of PCR products. Our HL-UDG 2.0 is recombinantly expressed and
purified through multiple steps. Activity Definition One unit (U) of activity

Thermostable UDG (Uracil-DNA Glycosylase) is also available by inquiry, which
can be transported at room temperature. Description Thermostable UDG (Uracil-
DNA Glycosylase) hydrolyzes the N-glycosidic bond between uracil bases and
deoxyribose in DNA chains, releasing free uracil. This enzyme acts on single-
stranded or double-stranded DNA containing dU and is not active against RNA.
It is sourced from thermophilic microorganisms and exhibits higher enzymatic
activity at elevated temperatures. In high-temperature PCR reactions,
especially during denaturation and extension phases, dCTP undergoes
deamination to form dUTP. This dUTP can be incorporated into DNA by
polymerases, resulting in the presence of dU in the DNA. Additionally, high
temperatures can cause deamination of dC bases in DNA to form dU bases. These
dU bases in DNA can inhibit the activity of high-fidelity DNA polymerases,
such as Pfu DNA polymerase. Therefore, removing dU bases from DNA can enhance
the amplification yield of high-fidelity DNA polymerases. Our high-temperature
UDG enzyme can withstand temperatures up to 95°C, with a half-life exceeding 1
hour at 95°C. Thus, this high-temperature UDG serves as an excellent enhancer
for increasing the amplification yield of high-fidelity DNA polymerases like
Pfu DNA polymerase. Our Thermostable UDG is recombinantly expressed and
purified through multiple steps. Activity Definition One unit of activity is
defined as the amount of enzyme required to catalyze the release of 60 pmol of
uracil from uracil-containing double-stranded DNA (dU/dA) per minute at 65°C.
Activity Assay Conditions Pfu PCR Buffer: 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8 at 25°C), 10
mM (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mM MgSO4,
incubated at 65°C. Features Heat-stable, retains enzymatic activity at
temperatures ranging from 50-90°C. Active in a variety of PCR enzyme buffers.
Applications Elimination of dU generated at high temperatures in DNA,
improving the performance of high-fidelity polymerases in amplification. Other
experimental procedures requiring the removal of dU at high temperatures.

Polymerase Amplification (RPA) Unraveling the Power of RPA Technology in
Genomic Detection, From Pathogens to Food Safety January 4, 2024 · Isothermal
Amp The images in this article are from the internet and used for illustrative
purposes. We respect intellectual property rights and comply with laws. If you
own the copyright and believe an image infringes your rights, please contact
us. Upon confirmation, we'll promptly remove or replace the image. Thank you
for your understanding. Since the advent of the Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) method, particularly with the continuous development of real-time
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) technology, nucleic acid amplification techniques have
permeated various fields of biological science. Recombinase Polymerase
Amplification (RPA), developed by the UK-based TwistDx Inc. in 2006, is an
isothermal amplification technology that has rapidly advanced in recent years.
This technique boasts advantages such as rapidity, sensitivity, excellent
specificity, and suitability for on-site rapid detection. It has been applied
successfully in diverse areas, including the detection of genetically modified
organisms, various pathogens, and food safety. Reaction Principle The RPA
reaction primarily relies on the recombinase UvsX and the recombinase loading
factor UvsY (auxiliary protein) derived from the T4 bacteriophage, along with
the Single-Stranded DNA-Binding Protein (SSB) Gp32, and the strand-displacing
DNA polymerase Bsu (Bacillus subtilis Pol) or Sau (Staphylococcus aureus Pol).
The amplification of the template is achieved based on the T4 bacteriophage's
nucleic acid replication mechanism. Initially, in the presence of Adenosine
Triphosphate (ATP), the primer forms a nucleoprotein filament complex with the
recombinase UvsX. This complex bi-directionally scans the target double-
stranded DNA for homologous sequences. Once a homologous sequence is found,
the recombinase dissociates the double-stranded DNA at this position, forming
a D-loop structure. One side of the D-loop remains double-stranded, undergoing
strand displacement, while the other side becomes single-stranded, stabilized
by the SSB protein Gp32. Subsequently, the nucleoprotein filament complex
actively hydrolyzes ATP, causing a conformational change and exposing the 3'
end of the primer. At this point, the DNA polymerase Bsu binds to the 3' end
of the primer, initiating the DNA amplification reaction and forming a new
complementary strand. In this reaction, the processes mediated by forward and
reverse primers occur simultaneously. The newly formed single strand pairs
with the original strand, generating a complete amplicon. This amplification
process repeats continuously, leading to exponential growth of the
amplification product. The entire process is typically completed within 20
minutes. During the reaction, competition exists between the SSB protein and
UvsX for primer binding sites. The auxiliary protein UvsY can invade the
primer-covered binding sites of the SSB protein, preventing the recombination
phenomenon that occurs when the SSB protein binds to the primer, and it can
facilitate the binding of UvsX to the primer, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Types of RPA Detection Methods Basic RPA Detection Basic RPA detection is a
nucleic acid detection method that combines RPA technology with agarose gel
electrophoresis. The main detection process involves performing RPA
amplification reaction under constant temperature conditions (37-39°C) for
20-40 minutes. After the reaction is completed, agarose gel electrophoresis is
used to detect the RPA amplification products. Components such as recombinase
and single-stranded binding protein in the RPA reaction system can bind to the
amplification products, inhibiting their migration in the gel. This can lead
to smear patterns in gel electrophoresis results. To avoid this, phenol and
chloroform are added to the amplification products in a 1:1 volume ratio. The
products are then extracted, and the extracted amplification products are
subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. Similar to the gel electrophoresis
process for PCR products, RPA amplification products are mixed with nucleic
acid dyes like EB before gel electrophoresis. The presence or absence of bands
and their sizes on the gel determine the detection results of the target
nucleic acid. Recombinase Polymerase Amplification with Lateral Flow Dipstick
(RPA-LFD) RPA-LFD is a nucleic acid detection method that combines RPA
technology with lateral flow dipstick (LFD). In comparison to the basic RPA
detection method, the RPA-LFD reaction system includes a DNA endonuclease
(nfo), an nfo probe, and a downstream primer labeled with biotin. The nfo
probe is approximately 50 nt long, with a FAM fluorescent group at the 5' end,
a blocking group (typically C3spacer) at the 3' end, and a tetrahydrofuran
(THF) molecule in the middle, as shown in Figure 2. The DNA endonuclease nfo
recognizes the THF molecule in the nfo probe and cleaves it. After cleavage,
the probe produces a free hydroxyl end, acting as an upstream primer. This new
upstream primer, along with the biotin-labeled downstream primer, undergoes
amplification to yield an amplification product with a FAM group at the 5' end
and biotin at the 3' end. This amplification product can be detected using a
lateral flow dipstick. Figure 2: Schematic Diagram of the Structure of the nfo
Probe LFD, based on lateral flow chromatography, immunology, and colloidal
gold technologies, is a type of test strip. The strip is mainly composed of
three parts: the sample pad, detection line, and control line. The sample pad
contains colloidal gold particles labeled with anti-FAM antibodies, the
detection line has a ligand with biotin, and the control line has another
antibody that can bind to anti-FAM antibodies. The specific detection
principle of LFD is illustrated in Figure 3. Firstly, the FAM groups on the
amplification product bind to the anti-FAM antibodies on the sample pad,
forming an immune complex. Then, all colloidal gold particles migrate to the
detection line under the action of the buffer solution. When they reach the
detection line, the biotin on the amplification product is captured by the
biotin ligand on the detection line, causing the amplification product to
aggregate. This aggregation results in the appearance of a red band on the
detection line. Colloidal gold particles that fail to bind to the
amplification product continue to migrate beyond the detection line. When they
reach the control line, the anti-FAM antibodies on the colloidal gold
particles bind to the antibodies on the control line, leading to the
aggregation of colloidal gold particles and the appearance of a red band on
the control line. The presence of a red band on the control line indicates the
completion of LFD detection. Therefore, when the test result is positive, two
red bands can be observed on the LFD – one on the detection line and one on
the control line. When the result is negative, only a red band on the control
line is visible on the LFD. Currently, LFD can be combined with various
nucleic acid amplification technologies such as LAMP, RCA, and RPA for the
detection of target nucleic acids. The advantage of RPA-LFD lies in its simple
operation, absence of complex instruments, and the ability to directly observe
the detection results with the naked eye, making it suitable for on-site rapid
testing. Figure 3: Schematic Diagram of LFD Detection Principle Real-time
Fluorescent RPA Detection The real-time fluorescent RPA detection method is a
nucleic acid detection approach that combines RPA technology with real-time
fluorescent detection technology. In comparison to the basic RPA detection
method's reaction system, the real-time fluorescent RPA reaction system
incorporates the nucleic acid endonuclease exo and exo probes. The exo probe
is a probe with a size of 46-52 nt, featuring a pair of thymine bases, each
carrying a fluorescent group and a quenching group. These thymine bases are
separated by a THF spacer, and the 3' end of the probe is connected to a
blocking group. The specific structure of the probe is illustrated in Figure
4. The fluorescent group in the probe is generally FAM, the quenching group is
typically BHQ, and the blocking group is commonly C3spacer. The nucleic acid
endonuclease exo can recognize THF molecules in the exo probe and, after
hybridization of the exo probe with the amplification product, cleave the THF
molecule. This cleavage separates the fluorescent and quenching groups in the
probe, leading to the generation of fluorescence. Equipment capable of real-
time monitoring of fluorescent signals can be used to detect the fluorescence
intensity during the reaction process, allowing for the determination of the
detection results for the target nucleic acid. Figure 4: Schematic Diagram of
the Structure of the exo Probe Currently, real-time fluorescent RPA detection
methods have found widespread application in pathogen detection, food safety,
and other fields. In comparison to basic RPA detection methods and RPA-LFD
methods, the real-time fluorescent RPA detection method offers notable
advantages with a shorter detection time, completing within 20 minutes.
Additionally, it exhibits high specificity and sensitivity. Figure 5:
Simplified Diagram of LFD-RPA Applications of RPA Since its inception, the RPA
technology has been applied in various fields such as single-gene mutation
detection, water sources, food safety, infectious disease detection, as well
as the detection of common pathogens in agriculture and animal husbandry. 1\.
Bacterial Detection Traditional bacterial cultivation is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and susceptible to contamination. RPA technology has shown
significant advantages in bacterial detection. For instance, E. coli, a normal
flora in the human intestinal tract, can cause severe enteritis and diarrhea
when consumed through contaminated food. Liu Jingwen and others utilized RT-
RPA with exo probes at 37°C to qualitatively detect E. coli within 20 minutes,
achieving a significantly shorter detection time compared to traditional
methods. The method also demonstrated a low detection limit of 0.01ng/μl,
providing technical support for rapid clinical diagnosis. Wang et al.
developed a dual-detection biosensor based on RPA and a three-stage lateral
flow strip. The biosensor performed dual-chain RPA reactions for Vibrio
cholerae and Vibrio vulnificus. This method boasts high sensitivity,
specificity, short reaction time, and simplicity, making it suitable for
grassroots hospitals and real-time on-site detection. 2\. Virus Detection RPA
technology is applicable for the immediate detection of various viruses
without cross-contamination. Yehia combined RPA technology with reverse
transcription to establish a detection method for the H5N1 virus,
demonstrating high sensitivity capable of detecting 1 copy of viral RNA.
Behrman integrated RPA technology with real-time fluorescence detection for a
rapid detection method of novel coronaviruses, achieving results within 15-20
minutes for 7 copies of viral RNA. RPA technology is also applicable to the
detection of Monkeypox virus, Newcastle disease virus, Spring viremia of carp
virus, African swine fever virus, Canine parvovirus, and others. 3\. Parasite
Detection In the realm of parasite detection, RPA methods have been
established for protozoa, nematodes, trematodes, and other parasites. Kersting
et al. targeted the amplification of the 18S rRNA gene fragment of the malaria
parasite using RPA-LFD, demonstrating high specificity and sensitivity under
mild reaction conditions. This method is suitable for on-site inspections in
remote areas, contributing to global progress in malaria prevention and
control. Guo Qinghong developed an RPA-LFD detection method for diagnosing
Japanese schistosomiasis in mice and sheep using the G01 fragment. The method
exhibited high sensitivity (97.22% for mice, 93.75% for sheep) and 100%
specificity for negative samples, showing no cross-reactivity with other
flukes. The results indicate that the RPA-LFD method has high specificity and
sensitivity for detecting Japanese schistosomiasis. 4\. Food Safety Detection
RPA technology is widely applied in food safety detection. Choi established a
detection method for Vibrio parahaemolyticus using RPA, achieving detection
within 20 minutes. Tang developed a real-time fluorescent RPA detection method
for Vibrio cholerae, capable of detecting 5 copies of bacterial DNA within 20
minutes. Additionally, RPA technology is utilized for the screening and
detection of genetically modified crops, with Chandu developing real-time
fluorescent RPA and RPA-LFD detection methods for genetically modified
soybeans. Conclusion Compared to PCR and other isothermal amplification
methods, RPA technology features isothermal amplification, rapidity,
sensitivity, specificity, ease of result interpretation, and operational
simplicity. It offers an economical solution that can be used under limited
resource conditions, presenting extensive development prospects. However,
there is currently no dedicated primer design software for RPA, and many
primers used in experiments may still be those used in traditional PCR,
potentially introducing experimental errors. With further research on RPA
technology, it is expected to mature and better fulfill its role in the
future. Subscribe Previous What Is Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification Used

Return to site Exploring Proteins in CRISPR Diagnosis: Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14
Unveiling the Intricacies of CRISPR Diagnosis and the Versatility of Cas12,
Cas13, and Cas14 Proteins · CRISPR In this era of rapid technological
advancement, CRISPR diagnosis has emerged as a captivating application of
biotechnology, drawing widespread attention. At the core of CRISPR diagnosis
is the utilization of specific protein families, including Cas12, Cas13, and
Cas14, forming complexes with proteins and guide molecules to achieve
recognition and cleavage of specific nucleic acid sequences. Basic Principles
of CRISPR Diagnosis The fundamental principle of CRISPR diagnosis involves a
process of non-specific cleavage. This technology comprises two key
components: the complex of proteins and guide molecules. These complexes first
cleave the specific nucleic acid sequences that users want to detect and then
proceed to cleave other non-specific nucleic acids. Modified nucleic acids,
also known as reporter genes, generate visual signals upon cleavage, making
them easily detectable only after the specific nucleic acids have been
cleaved. Introduction to Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14 Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14 are
crucial members of the protein family in CRISPR diagnosis, constituting the
protein part of the complex with proteins and guide molecules. These proteins
are derived from specific types of bacteria and archaea, yet they share some
key features. Cas12 Cas12 proteins directly bind and cleave user-specified DNA
sequences, capable of cleaving both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA.
After Cas12 proteins cleave their DNA targets, they non-specifically cleave
single-stranded DNA. Therefore, diagnostics based on Cas12 can only directly
detect DNA and must be combined with proteins that convert RNA to DNA for RNA
detection. Cas12 proteins are located on the larger side of CRISPR diagnostic
proteins, with a length of approximately 1,300 amino acids. Users employ 42-44
nt RNA molecules to specify Cas12 DNA targets. Cas12 dsDNA targets are
restricted as they must be located near short DNA fragments called protospacer
adjacent motifs (PAM). For some Cas12 proteins, the PAM sequence is TTTN.
Importantly, without PAM, diagnostics based on Cas12 cannot detect DNA
sequences. Cas12 proteins can easily distinguish very similar dsDNA sequences.
This functionality is lost when the target sequence is ssDNA. Cas13 Cas13
proteins directly bind and cleave user-specified RNA sequences, with a length
of approximately 1,400 amino acids. Similar to Cas12, Cas13 RNA guide
molecules are relatively short, around 64 nt. Cas13 proteins lack strong
targeting restrictions, but their RNA targets can adopt structures that are
challenging to cleave. Cas13 cleaves RNA sequences 1 nt away from specific
sequences, requiring careful testing when differentiating highly similar
sequences using Cas13-based diagnostics. Cas14 Cas14 proteins bind and cleave
specific single-stranded or double-stranded DNA. To detect RNA, diagnostics
based on Cas14 must be combined with proteins that can convert RNA to DNA.
Cas14 proteins have a smaller end, consisting of 400-700 amino acids. However,
their guide RNA is located on the longer side, approximately 140 nt. Cas14
proteins exhibit no targeting restrictions when cleaving ssDNA, making them
versatile. For dsDNA targeting, Cas14 proteins require a PAM sequence rich in
T, such as TTTA. Cas14 proteins can easily distinguish very similar ssDNA
sequences. Applications and Future Prospects of Protein Combinations Each
protein family has its advantages and disadvantages, but researchers have
demonstrated creative ways to combine proteins from multiple families in a
single detection. This combination can be used to simultaneously detect
multiple targets, opening up new possibilities for the widespread application
of CRISPR diagnostics. Scientists continue to discover and improve new CRISPR
systems, and it is believed that more innovative CRISPR diagnostic tools will
emerge in the future. These tools will find extensive applications in
healthcare, agriculture, food safety, infectious diseases, and other fields,
contributing to human health and societal development. At SBS Genetech , we
take pride in offering a comprehensive selection of Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14
proteins, empowering researchers and diagnostic professionals with cutting-
edge tools for CRISPR applications. Our diverse range of proteins is designed
to cater to various diagnostic needs, ensuring precision and efficiency in
nucleic acid sequence recognition and cleavage. Subscribe Previous Unraveling

Reverse Transcriptases Exploring Optimized Enzyme Solutions for Efficient cDNA
Synthesis and Amplification in Complex Genomic Studies July 11, 2023 · RNA-
Related The science of genetics has always been rooted in understanding the
intricate dance of DNA and RNA, which ultimately directs life's phenomenally
diverse expressions. SBS Genetech , with its series of reverse transcriptases,
takes a leap forward, introducing optimized enzymes that promise to enhance
the quality and efficacy of reverse transcription and amplification processes.
In this blog, let’s delve into the advanced offerings of four SBS Genetech’s
reverse transcriptases. Thermo-stable M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H-)
Creating a breakthrough in the world of genetics, Thermo-stable M-MLV Reverse
Transcriptase (RNase H-) unlocks the door to more efficient and stable cDNA
synthesis. With RNase H activity minimized through multiple point mutations,
this enzyme fosters reduced RNA degradation during reverse transcription,
facilitating an enriched yield of first-strand cDNA. Notably, its enhanced
thermal stability, with an optimal reaction temperature of 50°C, allows
researchers to attain full-length cDNA with relative ease. Ultra Thermo-stable
M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H-) Building upon the foundation of its
predecessor, the Ultra Thermo-stable M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H-)
pushes the boundaries with an enhanced thermal stability that extends the
enzyme's activity up to a striking 65°C. This thermal resilience enables
significant unfolding of RNA’s secondary structure at high temperatures,
promoting the amplification of complex RNA templates and thereby, amplifying
both the length and yield of cDNA. The boosted sensitivity of subsequent
detection is an added feather in its cap, heralding improved accuracy in
applications like RT-PCR. Prime Thermo-stable M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase
(RNase H-) Prime Thermo-stable M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H-) stands
out with its exceptional reverse transcription efficiency and thermal
resistance, extending its transcription temperature up to 72°C. Originating
from point mutations based on the wild-type M-MLV reverse transcriptase gene,
and expressed and purified via specially engineered bacteria, it significantly
enhances the tolerance to the complex secondary structures of RNA. With a
protein structure intact and akin to the wild type, it sustains polymerase
activity while boasting high synthesis capacity and commendable thermal
stability. Warm Activated Reverse Transcriptase Warm Activated Reverse
Transcriptase, an RNase H-deficient variant of M-MLV, finds its uniqueness in
utilizing nucleic acid adapter technology, which covalently binds to M-MLV and
inhibits its activity below 31°C, ensuring enhanced product specificity. With
gene modification and recombinant techniques under its belt, the enzyme's
optimal reaction temperature is elevated to 50°C, thereby improving its
extension capability and making it apt for elongated cDNA synthesis.
Conclusion Embarking on a journey with these sophisticated reverse
transcriptases from SBS Genetech, researchers and scientists can anticipate a
future where genetic transcription and amplification processes are not only
more efficient but also yield higher fidelity results. The nuanced
modifications and enhancements introduced in each of these enzymes ensure that
the reverse transcription is more reliable, stable, and adaptable to various
research needs and conditions. Since 2000, SBS Genetech has been at the

Return to site Return to site The Crucial Role of dNTPs in cDNA Synthesis Explore the pivotal role of dNTPs in cDNA synthesis, unraveling the intricate process where these molecular building blocks lay the foundation for converting RNA into complementary DNA strands July 13, 2023 · PCR-Related In the realm of molecular biology, the synthesis of complementary DNA (cDNA) stands as a fundamental technique with widespread applications, from gene expression analysis to understanding the intricacies of cellular processes. At the heart of cDNA synthesis lies a crucial player: deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). This article delves into the significance of dNTPs in the intricate process of cDNA synthesis. Understanding cDNA Synthesis cDNA synthesis is a pivotal technique that involves the conversion of RNA molecules into DNA. It serves as a cornerstone in various molecular biology applications, facilitating the study of gene expression and regulatory mechanisms. The process entails the utilization of a reverse transcriptase enzyme, which catalyzes the synthesis of a complementary DNA strand using an RNA template. The Role of dNTPs Central to the process of cDNA synthesis are dNTPs – the building blocks of DNA. Each dNTP molecule encompasses one of the four nitrogenous bases – adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine – along with a deoxyribose sugar and three phosphate groups. These molecules serve as the substrates for the reverse transcriptase enzyme during cDNA synthesis. Incorporation and Complementary Base Pairing During cDNA synthesis, dNTPs are incorporated into the growing DNA strand through complementary base pairing with the template RNA. For instance, if the template RNA harbors an adenine base, the reverse transcriptase enzyme will add a thymine-containing dNTP to the growing DNA strand. This process continues until the entire RNA template is transcribed into a complementary DNA strand. Ensuring Efficiency and Accuracy The presence of dNTPs is indispensable for efficient and accurate cDNA synthesis. Proper concentration and balance of dNTPs are vital to ensure optimal DNA synthesis and to prevent errors or biases in the resulting cDNA library. Typically, dNTPs are provided in excess during cDNA synthesis reactions to ensure an ample supply of building blocks for DNA synthesis. Conclusion In essence, dNTPs serve as the backbone of cDNA synthesis, facilitating the conversion of RNA into complementary DNA strands. Their precise incorporation through complementary base pairing ensures the fidelity and accuracy of the synthesized DNA. As researchers continue to explore the depths of molecular biology, the role of dNTPs in cDNA synthesis remains paramount, driving advancements in various fields ranging from genetics to medicine.

Return to site Understanding the Error Rate of M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase
Explore the intricacies of M-MLV reverse transcriptase error rates and their
implications in molecular biology experiments August 3, 2022 · RNA-Related
Reverse transcriptases are essential enzymes used in molecular biology to
convert RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA), a crucial step in various
applications such as gene expression analysis, cloning, and sequencing. One
commonly used reverse transcriptase is derived from the Moloney Murine
Leukemia Virus (M-MLV). Understanding its error rate is fundamental for
accurate interpretation of experimental results and designing reliable assays.
Factors Influencing Error Rate The error rate of M-MLV reverse transcriptase
can vary due to several factors: Reaction Conditions: Variables such as
temperature, buffer composition, and presence of co-factors can influence the
fidelity of the enzyme. RNA Template: The sequence and structure of the RNA
template being reverse transcribed can affect the likelihood of errors during
cDNA synthesis. Length of Synthesized cDNA: Longer cDNA molecules may be more
prone to errors due to increased chances of misincorporation or slippage
during synthesis. Estimated Error Rate The error rate of M-MLV reverse
transcriptase is commonly estimated to range from approximately 1 in 10^4 to
10^5 nucleotides incorporated. This means that, on average, one error occurs
per several thousand bases transcribed. However, it's important to recognize
that this is a rough estimate and actual error rates can vary based on
experimental conditions and specific RNA targets. Implications and
Considerations Understanding the error rate of M-MLV reverse transcriptase is
crucial for various applications: Gene Expression Analysis: In quantitative
reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and RNA sequencing experiments, accurate
measurement of gene expression levels relies on faithful cDNA synthesis.
Errors introduced during reverse transcription can lead to misinterpretation
of expression profiles. Cloning and Mutagenesis: Errors in cDNA synthesis can
result in the introduction of mutations, affecting downstream applications
such as cloning or site-directed mutagenesis. Careful consideration of error
rates is necessary to minimize unintended mutations. Evolutionary Studies:
Studies investigating RNA viruses or RNA-based evolutionary processes rely on
reverse transcription for genomic analysis. Understanding error rates provides
insights into the evolutionary dynamics and adaptation of these organisms.
Conclusion M-MLV reverse transcriptase is a versatile enzyme widely used in
molecular biology applications. Its error rate, although relatively low
compared to some polymerases, remains a critical consideration for the
accuracy and reliability of experimental results. Researchers must be aware of
the factors influencing error rates and employ appropriate controls and
validation strategies to mitigate potential errors and ensure robust data
interpretation. Continuing research into enzyme engineering and optimization
may further enhance the fidelity of reverse transcription techniques,
advancing our understanding of RNA biology and its applications. Why Choose

COVID-19 IVD Raw Materials: The 9 Enzymes You MUST kNOW... Return to site
Return to site COVID-19 IVD Raw Materials: The 9 Enzymes You MUST kNOW Core in
vitro diagnostic enzyme raw materials used in COVID-19 nucleic acid detection
August 10, 2022 · COVID-19 Enzymes are very important biocatalysts with high
catalytic efficiency and reaction specificity. Most biochemical reactions
require the participation of enzymes, and nucleic acid detection is no
exception. In the process of COVID-19 nucleic acid detection, different types
of molecular enzymes play important roles in different experimental stages of
nucleic acid detection (nucleic acid extraction & RT-qPCR). Here, we sorted
out the core enzyme raw materials used in the nucleic acid detection process
according to the different experimental links in the nucleic acid detection.
Core enzymes in nucleic acid extraction The process of COVID-19 nucleic acid
extraction mainly includes two steps: Lysis is the process of destroying the
cell structure of the sample, so that the nucleic acid in the sample can be
released. Purification is to completely separate the nucleic acid from other
components in the lysis system, such as protein, salt and other impurities.
The reaction process requires the participation of Proteinase K , DNase I and
RNasin (RNase inhibitor) . Proteinase K Proteinase K is a serine protease with
wide cleavage activity, which can cleave the carboxyl terminal peptide bond of
aliphatic and aromatic amino acids. In the process of nucleic acid extraction,
proteinase K can degrade histone closely bound with nucleic acid, promote the
separation of nucleic acid, and make the nucleic acid better extracted. In
addition, proteinase K can degrade the activity of RNA hydrolase (RNase) and
inhibit the hydrolysis of template RNA by RNase. Our Mutant Proteinase K has
higher specific activity and is more stable at room temperature compared with
wild-type Proteinase K. It is a non-specific serine proteinase with broad
substrates. It is active over the pH range from 4 to 12 and can be used in any
situation to digest native and denatured proteins. The application of this
Mutant Proteinase K is similar to wild-type Proteinase K. But this mutant one
has higher specific activity and is more stable at room temperature. It can be
used in any situation to digest native and denatured proteins. For instance,
it is used for isolating mRNA or genomic DNA from different tissues and
modifying glycoprotein for structure studies. Mutant Proteinase K is active
with SDS, urea, and EDTA and active between 15°C and 75°C. Our Mutant
Proteinase K is included in New Products, Science Journal, March 8, 2019 .
Mutant Proteinase K latest list price: $400 for 10g DNase I DNase I (RNase
Free) is an endonuclease that decomposes single- or double-stranded DNA to
produce 5'-P-terminal oligonucleotides. As the protease is almost completely
removed, the stability of DNase I in pH neutral region is improved. In
addition, RNase inhibitor is added to DNase I to inhibit the residual RNase in
RNA samples, so it can effectively inhibit RNase degradation of RNA during the
extraction. Generally, DNase I can be inactivated by heating. If it is
necessary to remove the residual denatured protein, the RNA sample can be
extracted and precipitated with phenol-chloroform after digestion at 37°C
(without heating). DNase I (RNase Free) latest list price 2022: $350/g RNasin
(RNase inhibitor) RNasin (RNase inhibitor) is a ribonuclease inhibitor
extracted from human placenta with a molecular weight 51 kDa. It inhibits the
activity of RNase by specifically binding up to RNase with a non-covalent
bond. RNasin, free of RNase or Nickase, can maintain its activity at pH from 5
to 8, with the highest activity at pH 7.8. The concentration of RNasin is
20~40 units/µl. RNasin (RNase inhibitor) can be used in almost any application
where RNase contamination may exist. Our high-quality RNasin can inhibit RNase
more extensively than many traditional RNase inhibitors, so it has become a
better choice of RNase inhibitor at present, which can provide a higher level
of protection against RNA degradation. RNasin (RNase inhibitor) latest list
price 2022: $1,000 for 100KU Core enzymes in RT-qPCR After the nucleic acid
extraction of the sample is completed, the nucleic acid detection can be
completed by RT-qPCR. In these experiments, DNA Polymerase , Reverse
Transcriptase and Uracil DNA Glycosylase are essential core enzyme materials.
Reverse Transcriptase After extracting purified RNA, dNTP polymerization
catalyzed by reverse transcriptase is required before qPCR reaction to
generate cDNA sequence complementary to template RNA. For RT-qPCR reaction,
the reverse transcriptase that can withstand high temperature should be
selected. At present, the most widely used reverse transcriptase is M-MLV
reverse transcriptase. Because it lacks DNA endonuclease activity and has low
RNase H activity, it has more advantages in cDNA cloning application. Thermo-
stable M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H-) is able to synthesize the
complementary DNA strand from a single-strand RNA template. M-MLV Reverse
Transcriptase (RNase H-) is a mutant type of M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase,
obtained by eliminating the active center of RNase H through multiple point
mutations. The alteration decreases the activity of RNase H and reduces RNA
degradation in reverse transcription, which increases the yield of first-
strand cDNA to get full-length cDNA more easily. In addition, the thermal
stability of the reverse transcriptase is improved and the optimal reaction
temperature is therefore 50°C. Ultra Thermo-stable M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase
(RNase H-) is a mutant type of M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase, obtained by
eliminating the active center of RNase H through multiple point mutations. The
alteration decreases the activity of RNase H and reduces RNA degradation in
reverse transcription, which increases the yield of first-strand cDNA and gets
full-length cDNA more easily. In addition, the thermal stability of the
reverse transcriptase is improved and the enzyme is active up to 65°C.
Compared with RT-PCR at low temperature, RT-PCR at a high temperature can
significantly open the secondary structure of RNA, promote the amplification
performance of complex RNA templates, increase the length and yield of cDNA,
and improve the sensitivity of subsequent detection. This product has a high
concentration (200U/μl) and is glycerol-free, which can be used to establish a
freeze-drying system. Thermo-stable M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H-)
latest list price 2022: $1,500/MU Ultra Thermo-stable M-MLV Reverse
Transcriptase (RNase H-) latest list price 2022: $300 for 20KU DNA Polymerase
After the reverse transcription process is completed to generate double
stranded cDNA, the DNA polymerase in the PCR reaction is then required. The
DNA strand is extended by polymerizing free deoxyribonucleotides ( dNTPs ),
and a large amount of template DNA is amplified in vitro to achieve the
purpose of nucleic acid detection. The commonly used polymerase is Taq DNA
Polymerase or U-Taq DNA Polymerase . U-Taq DNA Polymerase consists of a single
polypeptide with a molecular weight of 94 kDa. It has a 5'→3' DNA polymerase
activity and lacks 3'→5' exonuclease activity. Its extension rate is 2~4
kb/min in standard conditions. The appropriate reaction temperature is 70~75℃,
the work concentration of dNTPs is 100~300 μM, the work concentration of Mg 2+
is 2~3 mM, and the suitable pH is 8.1~9.1. The enzyme generates PCR products
with 3'-dA overhangs, suitable for T-A cloning. The amount of enzyme is 1~1.5
unit for 20μl PCR reaction, while 2~3 unit for 50μl PCR reaction. 6 kb Lambda
DNA and 2.1 kb Human genomic DNA can be amplified very well at our laboratory.
HM-Taq DNA Polymerase adopts the latest synthetic affinity ligand technology,
which can reversibly block the activity of the Taq DNA Polymerase in a
temperature-dependent manner. The difference between the HM-Taq DNA Polymerase
and the general hot start Taq DNA Polymerase is that the general hot start Taq
DNA Polymerase only blocks the polymerase activity before the temperature rise
in the first step, while the HM-Taq DNA Polymerase uses the inhibitory ligand
to block the substrate-binding site of the HM-Taq DNA Polymerase through
temperature regulation. When the temperature is lower than 40°C, an inactive
enzyme-inhibitor complex is formed. When the temperature rises to the
annealing temperature, the binding balance moves towards the formation of the
template-primer complex, so the production of non-specific amplification
products in the whole process of PCR amplification is minimized and the
accuracy of PCR reaction is greatly improved. The 3' end of PCR product is A,
which can be cloned directly with the TA vector. HS-Taq DNA Polymerase (also
known as HotStart-Taq DNA Polymerase) contains engineered Taq polymerase and
Taq monoclonal antibody, thereby preventing DNA synthesis at room temperature.
During the initial DNA denaturation step, the antibody is denatured, releasing
the polymerase and allowing DNA synthesis to proceed. HS-Taq DNA Polymerase
prevents nonspecific amplification due to mispriming and/or the formation of
primer-dimers during PCR assembly. U-Taq DNA Polymerase latest list price

Glycosylase In the process of COVID-19 nucleic acid detection, aerosol
pollution in the operating environment is the most common factor causing false
positive PCR results. Adding UDG enzyme (uracil DNA glycosylase) to the
amplification system can effectively eliminate the amplification residual
contamination (mostly in the form of aerosol) mixed in the PCR system and
ensure the accuracy of the amplification results. Heat-Labile Uracil DNA
Glycosylase can effectively hydrolyze uracil-glycosidic bonds in single- or
double-stranded DNA, excising uracil and creating alkali-sensitive abasic
sites in the DNA, which can be hydrolyzed by endonuclease, heat, or alkali
treatment. The enzyme has no activity to RNA and is mainly used to prevent
contamination in the PCR reaction system. The uracil DNA glycosylase from
E.coli is relatively heat-resistant, and a small amount of uracil DNA
glycosylase activity remains after being treated at 95°C for 10 min, which
leads to the degradation of PCR products containing dU base. While the HL-UDG
from psychrophilic marine bacteria is completely inactivated at 55°C for 5
min. Before PCR amplification, HL-UDG is added to the PCR reaction system, and
the contamination in the system could be eliminated at 25°C for 10 min. HL-UDG
will then be inactivated in the first step of denaturation (at 94°C) of the
PCR cycle, preventing the degradation of the synthesized PCR products
containing dU. Heat-Labile Uracil DNA Glycosylase latest list price 2022: $500

Reactions: Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase At SBS Genetech, we are at the forefront of
offering solutions for isothermal amplification based on our world-class
platform. Our Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is at the core of this platform, which is
a mixture of Bst Polymerase and extremely thermostable reverse transcriptase.
Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is suitable for isothermal amplification reaction of
both DNA and RNA templates, which can detect low-sensitivity nucleic acid
templates with great efficiency and specificity. Besides, with a special
preparation process, this enzyme has a fast amplification rate and high
tolerance to impurity. Since our Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is extremely
thermostable and also provides sensitive reverse transcriptase activity, it is
reported to have higher sensitivity at high Ct values. [1] [1] Lu S, Duplat D,

DNA/RNA Polymerase Bst P DNA/RNA Polymerase is an upgraded version of Bst
DNA/RNA Polymerase through enzyme electronic re-structure and evolution
screening (in silico Design & in vitro Evolution), which is generally used for
LAMP or RT-LAMP amplification of DNA or RNA. Performance improvements include:
The whole Bst P DNA/RNA System includes hot start Aptamer, which ensures that
the enzyme activity blocking efficiency is >95% at <30°C, and the enzyme
activity is completely released within 1 min at >60°C. This characteristic
facilitates the establishment of the reaction system at room temperature and
greatly reduces the non-specific amplification at low temperatures. The
reaction temperature is further raised to 70°C, which greatly reduces the
formation of primer dimer, improves the amplification specificity, and makes
the nucleic acid release of crude samples more sufficient. The whole portfolio
contains Helicase, so Premium LAMP amplification (pLAMP) is allowed without
using F3/B3 primers. At the same time, Helicase has the function of assisting
in strand unwinding, which further reduces the concentration of FIP/BIP
primers. This will further reduce non-specific amplification and greatly
improve amplification homogeneity. Below are the lyophilized LAMP microbeads

platform. Our Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is at the core of this platform, which is
a mixture of Bst Polymerase and extremely thermostable reverse transcriptase.
Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is suitable for isothermal amplification reaction of
both DNA and RNA templates, which can detect low-sensitivity nucleic acid
templates with great efficiency and specificity. Besides, with a special
preparation process, this enzyme has a fast amplification rate and high
tolerance to impurity. Since our Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is extremely
thermostable and also provides sensitive reverse transcriptase activity, it is
reported to have higher sensitivity at high Ct values. [1] [1] Lu S, Duplat D,

DNA/RNA Polymerase Bst P DNA/RNA Polymerase is an upgraded version of Bst
DNA/RNA Polymerase through enzyme electronic re-structure and evolution
screening (in silico Design & in vitro Evolution), which is generally used for
LAMP or RT-LAMP amplification of DNA or RNA. Performance improvements include:
The whole Bst P DNA/RNA System includes hot start Aptamer, which ensures that
the enzyme activity blocking efficiency is >95% at <30°C, and the enzyme
activity is completely released within 1 min at >60°C. This characteristic
facilitates the establishment of the reaction system at room temperature and
greatly reduces the non-specific amplification at low temperatures. The
reaction temperature is further raised to 70°C, which greatly reduces the
formation of primer dimer, improves the amplification specificity, and makes
the nucleic acid release of crude samples more sufficient. The whole portfolio
contains Helicase, so Premium LAMP amplification (pLAMP) is allowed without
using F3/B3 primers. At the same time, Helicase has the function of assisting
in strand unwinding, which further reduces the concentration of FIP/BIP
primers. This will further reduce non-specific amplification and greatly
improve amplification homogeneity. Below are the lyophilized LAMP microbeads

Description PrimeIAmp™ SG Fluorescent Dye Lyophilized Isothermal Amplification
Microbeads contain reaction buffer, SG fluorescent dye, Mg 2+ , dNTP , Bst
DNA/RNA polymerase , and so on in the lyophilized form. Only primers and
templates are needed to be added for the isothermal amplification. SG
fluorescent dye is specially designed for real-time fluorescence detection.
PrimeIAmp™ SG Fluorescent Dye Lyophilized Isothermal Amplification Microbeads
can be stored at room temperature (25°C) for 6 months. Storage The minimum
shelf life is 6 months at 25°C and 2 years at -20°C. The product can be
transported at room temperature. After the product is opened, the unused
product should be sealed with sealing film or electrical tape to prevent
performance degradation due to moisture. The product can also be vacuum packed
in a 0.2 ml EP tube. Note When used in other isothermal amplification
reactions (such as CPA, SMAP, etc.), the above strategies can be referred to
while the reaction time may need to be adjusted. After the reaction system is
prepared, a drop of mineral oil can be added to cover the upper part of the
reaction liquid to reduce aerosol pollution. Preparation of complete
amplification system using lyophilized microbeads: Pack optimized primers at
the bottom of 0.2 ml EP tube and dry at 70-80°C for 1-2h. The dried 0.2 ml EP
tube already contains dried amplification primers, and then add a lyophilized
microbead to prepare the complete amplification system, which can be stored
for a long time, without the need for cold chain transportation. There is no
detergent in the product. Adding Tween20 with a final concentration of 0.5% to
the reaction system will accelerate the reaction speed for about 3min.
Preparation method of Tween20 with 10× concentration: Tween20 is dissolved in
ddH 2 O with a concentration of 5%, and the pH is adjusted to 8.8 with dilute
NaOH solution (50mM). The solution is used as 10×, and 2.5μl is used for each
microbead. Under the condition of low-temperature storage, before opening the
cap, the bottle shall be placed at room temperature to make the temperature of
the lyophilized microbeads to be consistent with the room temperature, which
can prevent moisture in the air from being absorbed by microbeads due to the
difference in temperature. Instruction: Protocol Related: Lyophilized beads

Microbeads is a full-system lyophilized microbead product, which contains Bst
P DNA/RNA Polymerase , SYBR Green dye, Helicase, dNTP, Mg2+, reaction buffer
salt, lyophilized excipient. The amplification system is 25μl for each
microbead. Features The whole Bst P DNA/RNA System includes hot start Aptamer,
which ensures that the enzyme activity blocking efficiency is >95% at <30°C,
and the enzyme activity is completely released within 1 min at >60°C. This
characteristic facilitates the establishment of the reaction system at room
temperature and greatly reduces the non-specific amplification at low
temperatures. The reaction temperature is further raised to 70°C, which
greatly reduces the formation of primer dimer, improves the amplification
specificity, and makes the nucleic acid release of crude samples more
sufficient. The whole portfolio contains Helicase, so Premium LAMP
amplification (pLAMP) is allowed without using F3/B3 primers. At the same
time, Helicase has the function of assisting in strand unwinding, which
further reduces the concentration of FIP/BIP primers. This will further reduce
non-specific amplification and greatly improve amplification homogeneity.

Return to site Congratulations to Our Customer for Published in Science (IF:
42)! The first team in the world to analyze the high-resolution three-
dimensional structure of minor spliceosome March 25, 2021 · News, Publications
On January 28, 2021, Professor Yigong Shi's research team of Westlake
University and Tsinghua University published a scientific research paper
entitled " Structure of the activated human minor spliceosome " in Science
journal (impact factor: 41.84), which is another major breakthrough in the
study of spliceosome structure and mechanism. In this paper, the team reported
the high-resolution three-dimensional structure of the minor spliceosome for
the first time , which is poorly understood so far, and showed a key
conformation in the splicing reaction - activated minor spliceosome (defined
as "minor B act complex"), with an overall resolution up to 2.9Å. This major
breakthrough made Professor Yigong Shi's research team become the first team
in the world to analyze the high-resolution three-dimensional structure of
minor spliceosome, after first analyzing the world's first spliceosome
structure in 2015 and the first human source spliceosome structure in 2017.
DOI: 10.1126/science.abg0879 In this research work, GoodView™ from Beijing SBS
Genetech Co Ltd was used in in vitro splicing assay and RT-PCR for the
staining of nucleic acid. GoodView™ is a safer nucleic acid stain, an
alternative to the traditional ethidium bromide (EB) stain for detecting
nucleic acid in agarose gels. It emits green fluorescence when bound to DNA or
RNA. This new stain has two fluorescence excitation maxima when bound to
nucleic acid, one centered at 268 nm and the other at 294 nm. In addition, it
has one visible excitation at 491 nm. The Fluorescence emission of GoodView
bound to DNA is centered at 530 nm. GoodView™ Nucleic Acid Stain is also
included on New Products, Science Magazine, January 11, 2019 . We are honored
to create value for our customers and facilitate the development of science.

SBS Genetech: Leading the Evolution of One-Step RT-PCR ... Return to site
Return to site SBS Genetech: Leading the Evolution of One-Step RT-PCR The
viewpoint of One-Step RT-PCR technologies May 10, 2021 · PCR-Related, News
One-step RT-PCR provides a convenient and powerful way for RNA detection and
quantification. In the process of one-step RT-PCR, RNA is first transcribed
into cDNA by the enzyme with reverse transcription activity, and then it is
detected qualitatively by PCR or quantitatively by qPCR under the
amplification of the enzyme with DNA polymerase activity. All of these is done
in a single tube, which can greatly reduce the potential contaminations. The
traditional one step RT-PCR carries out the above reactions by two enzymes.
The reverse transcription is done by reverse transcriptase like Moloney Murine
Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase (M-MLV RT) or Avian Myeloblastosis Virus
Reverse Transcriptase (AMV RT). And the DNA polymerization is done by DNA
polymerase like Taq DNA polymerase or Pfu DNA polymerase. This two-enzyme
system seems to be the most popular one used by researchers worldwide, but it
has its own weak point. Because M-MLV RT or AMV RT also have DNA-dependent
polymerase activity, in the process of constant temperature reverse
transcription, the reverse transcriptase will cause dimer amplification and
extension between primers, resulting in the performance degradation of hot
start DNA polymerase. This will lead in limited amplification sensitivity and
false positive amplification. To save the problem caused by the two-enzyme
system, scientists have been looking for enzymes which have both reverse
transcription activity and DNA polymerase activity. One enzyme isolated from
Thermus thermophilus has aroused the interest of all. Tth DNA Polymerase, a
thermostable DNA polymerase, has both 5'-3' polymerase activity and 3'-5'
exonuclease activity. And in the presence of Mn 2+ , Tth DNA polymerase shows
an additional reverse transcriptase activity. This discovery was perceived as
a breakthrough in this field. However, the following research showed that the
reverse transcription activity of Tth DNA polymerase is not very good, so it
cannot be widely used in TaqMan PCR-based gene detection and diagnosis.
Through hard work of scientists, another enzyme called TTx DNA polymerase is
developed. Its reverse transcription activity is much higher than that of Tth
DNA polymerase. With high tolerance to PCR inhibitors, TTx DNA polymerase is
effective for amplification from crude samples with high efficiency. With
mentioned characteristics, TTx DNA polymerase seems very promising. However,
like Tth DNA polymerase, the activity of TTx DNA polymerase still depends on
Mn 2+ , which has inhibitory activity to PCR. This shortcoming limits the
application of this enzyme. At SBS Genetech, we are at the forefront of
offering comprehensive solutions for PCR-Related products, from basic to
advanced. One highlight of our PCR-Related products is our PrimeTaq™ HS DP
DNA/RNA Polymerase . Like TTx DNA polymerase, our PrimeTaq™ HS DP DNA/RNA
Polymerase has 5'-3' polymerase activity, 3'-5' exonuclease activity and
strong reverse transcription activity. However, unlike TTx DNA polymerase,
PrimeTaq™ HS DP DNA/RNA Polymerase depends on Mg 2+ instead of Mn 2+ , so it
won’t be limited by its buffer system, and can be used in various
applications. Besides, this enzyme has hot start property and high tolerance
to many PCR inhibitors. High tolerance delivers convenience for both DNA and
RNA amplification by allowing PCR directly from samples without prior
purification. With hot start property, the polymerase is 100% inactive below
50°C and can be completely recovered only after heating at 92°C for 5 min.
Therefore, the system can effectively inhibit non-specific PCR amplification,
greatly improving the specificity and sensitivity. One-step RT-PCR have been
developing rapidly in recent year, and is now playing a significant role in
both scientific research and molecular diagnosis. We are glad to be a part of
it. At SBS Genetech, we are committed to providing high quality product for
the scientific community, driving the development of science and technology.

Glycosylase (UDG enzyme), which recognizes and cleaves sites containing dUTP,
to prevent false positives in PCR amplification due to contamination of PCR
products. This product is suitable for PCR amplification involving members of
the A family of polymerases, such as Taq polymerase, and can also be used in
isothermal amplification involving Bst DNA Polymerase. Enzymes that can
utilize dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP may not necessarily be compatible with
dUTP; specific enzyme compatibility should be referenced in the enzyme's
product documentation or determined through testing. The dNTP/dUTP Mixture is
often used in combination with Uracil DNA Glycosylase (UDG enzyme) to
establish a dUTP/UDG enzyme contamination prevention system. The UDG enzyme
removes previous amplification products containing deoxyuracil (dU), which may
contaminate subsequent gene amplification detection systems, effectively
reducing false positives during PCR, qPCR, and isothermal amplification
reactions. This dNTP/dUTP Mixture is prepared with ultrapure water and pH-
adjusted to 7.0 using a high-purity NaOH solution. Features The product is
free from DNase, RNase, phosphatases, and proteases, making it suitable for
various routine molecular biology experiments including gene detection.
Storage Store at -20°C. Precaution For environmental contaminants containing
gene amplification products that do not contain dU, Uracil DNA Glycosylase
(UDG enzyme) cannot exert its effect. In such cases, considering redesigning
primers to target different amplification regions and establishing a dUTP/UDG
enzyme contamination prevention system can effectively reduce false positives
caused by environmental contamination from gene amplification products. It can
be dissolved at room temperature. After dissolution, it is advisable to store
it in a cooler or on an ice bath. After use, it should be promptly stored at
-20°C. This product is intended for scientific research by professionals only

ddNTP Mix (10mM each, Suitable for MALDI-MS) is a mixture of ddATP, ddCTP,
ddGTP, and ddTTP, each at a concentration of 10mM. This mixture is designed
for Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS)
analysis. It serves as a specialized set of mass-modified terminators for use
in single-nucleotide extension reactions, enabling mass spectrometric
analysis. Similar to "iPLEX Termination Mix" by Sequenom or Agena, this ddNTP
Mix contains a modified ddTTP with a higher molecular weight compared to
regular ddTTP. The distinct molecular weights after incorporation into DNA are
approximately 271 Da, 247 Da, 287 Da, and 327 Da for ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, and
the modified ddTTP, respectively. This facilitates high-throughput Single
Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis using MassArray mass spectrometry. The
discovery of several matrices capable of ionizing DNA and RNA has propelled
Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF MS) into a powerful platform for nucleic acid research. It can be
used to investigate sequence variations such as mutations, Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions/deletions, alternative splicing, copy number
variations, gene expression, allele-specific expression, DNA methylation,
post-transcriptional modifications in tRNA and rRNA, and more. ddNTP
(Dideoxynucleoside Triphosphate) differs from dNTP (deoxynucleoside
triphosphate) as it lacks a 3'OH group due to the presence of a dideoxyribose
moiety. This prevents the formation of phosphodiester bonds necessary for the
addition of subsequent nucleotides during DNA synthesis or amplification,
resulting in chain termination. Hence, ddNTPs are often referred to as "chain-
terminating nucleotides." In regular ddNTPs, the molecular weight differences
among products after single-nucleotide extension are small, ranging from 9 to
40 Da, making high-throughput genotyping via mass spectrometry challenging.
The modified ddTTP in this product has a larger molecular weight, ensuring
differences of 15 Da or more among the products, allowing for genotyping based
on the mass differences of the terminal bases. This innovation makes high-
throughput genotyping feasible using mass spectrometry. The approximate mass
differences (Da) for each terminator are presented in the table below:

Return to site 5 Features to Look for When Comparing Different Types of Bst
Polymerases Amplification speed, reverse transcription activity, impurity
tolerance, specificity, and what August 22, 2022 · Isothermal Amp When it
comes to finding the best Bst Polymerase for your research, it’s tempting to
look at the polymerase with the highest amplification speed, reverse
transcription activity, impurity tolerance, and specificity. But inevitably,
cost becomes a factor. Researchers have to consider which options are most
affordable while meeting the needs. Today’s midrange Bst Polymerases like Bst
DNA Polymerase offer great performance. Compared with wild-type Bst DNA
polymerase (large fragment), Bst DNA Polymerase has been greatly improved in
terms of amplification speed, yield, salt tolerance, and thermal stability.
Therefore, it is an excellent enzyme for most isothermal amplification. But
how do you know which affordable Bst Polymerase is best for you and your
research? As you search for the right fit, look out for these 5 must-know
features that will have the greatest impact on your productivity while staying
within budget: Amplification Speed Amplification speed is very important as it
can help to shorten the experimental time, resulting in higher research
efficiency. The wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large fragment) has a
comparatively low amplification speed, so the detection time takes long time.
Fortunately, with electronic reconstruction and e nzyme evolution technology,
the performance can be largely improved, including the amplification speed.
Wild-type Bst DNA Polymerase (Large Fragment):🌟 Bst DNA Polymerase ：🌟🌟 Bst
Polymerase ：🌟🌟🌟🌟 Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase ：🌟🌟🌟🌟 Reverse Transcription Activity
Reverse transcription activity is extremely important when you are using RNA
templates. The wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large fragment) and Bst DNA
Polymerase have very limited reverse transcription activity, so they are not
suitable for the RNA samples. With genetic engineering, Bst Polymerase has
strong reverse transcription activity and can carry out reverse transcription
without any other enzymes. Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is a mixture of Bst
Polymerase and extremely thermostable reverse transcriptase (65°C tolerant).
With addition of reverse transcriptase, it is even more suitable for the
isothermal amplification reaction of RNA. Low-sensitivity RNA molecules can be
detected with Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase. Wild-type Bst DNA Polymerase (Large
Fragment):🌟 Bst DNA Polymerase ：🌟 Bst Polymerase ：🌟🌟🌟 Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase
：🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Impurity Tolerance The impurities in samples can greatly impact the
amplification of the enzymes. Without optimization, wild-type Bst DNA
polymerase (large fragment) has poor performance when there are contaminations
in the sample, resulting in the failure of the detection. Fortunately, with
electronic reconstruction and enzyme evolution technology, the impurity
tolerance can be largely improved. Wild-type Bst DNA Polymerase (Large
Fragment):🌟 Bst DNA Polymerase ：🌟🌟 Bst Polymerase ：🌟🌟🌟🌟 Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase
：🌟🌟🌟🌟 Specificity Specificity is an important parameter to evaluate the
ability of a screening test to detect a true negative or positive. With high-
speed amplification characteristics, the wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large
fragment) will inevitably lead to false positive amplification, especially
when primers are at high concentration, resulting in low specificity.
Fortunately, with genetic engineering, higher specificity can be achieved.
Besides, the engineered enzyme has a strong recognition ability to dUTP. The
dTTP needed for amplification reaction can be completely replaced by dUTP, so
the amplification products all contain dUTP. By adding Heat-Labile Uracil DNA
Glycosylase (HL-UDG) , aerosol pollutants will be completely removed in the
initial reaction stage. The HL-UDG can be later inactivated irreversibly
within 3 min at 65°C, which not only eliminates the pollutants but also
ensures the normal amplification of nucleic acid. Therefore, the false
positive caused by aerosol pollution in the reaction can be greatly reduced.
Wild-type Bst DNA Polymerase (Large Fragment):🌟 Bst DNA Polymerase ：🌟🌟🌟🌟 Bst
Polymerase ：🌟🌟🌟🌟 Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase ：🌟🌟🌟🌟 Whether This Enzyme is
Lyophilizable Freeze drying or lyophilization technology has been widely used
in the fields of medicine, biological products, food, blood products and
active substances, and has been gradually applied in enzyme reagents. The
advantages of freeze drying are as follows: Stable structure The biological
activity is basically unchanged Porous, with good rehydration and good
efficacy Eliminates 95% ~ 99% moisture and can be stored at room temperature
or in a refrigerator for a long time However, most Bst Polymerases on the
market are not ideal for lyophilization, as there are two prerequisites.
First, the enzyme shall have a high concentration. Second, the enzyme has to
be glycerol-free. At SBS Genetech, we provide both Bst Polymerase (glycerol-
free) and Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase (glycerol-free) which are lyophilizable.
Besides, we also offer Bst DNA/RNA Lyo Buffer . With this optimized buffer,
there is no need to optimize the conditions of the freeze-drying protective
agent. Subscribe Previous Bst Polymerase vs Taq Polymerase: How to Select

Start Your Rolling Circle Amplification At SBS Genetch, we are at the
forefront of offering solutions for RCA with advanced enzymes and primers
October 23, 2022 · Isothermal Amp Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) is an
isothermal amplification technology developed based on the circular pathogenic
microorganism DNA/RNA molecular rolling replication in nature. Using a small
segment of cyclic oligonucleotides as a template and dNTPs/NTPs as raw
materials, a long repetitive single-stranded DNA/RNA is produced by
amplification under the action of DNA/RNA polymerase. The amplification
methods include linear amplification and exponential amplification. RCA has
been widely used in genomics, proteomics, molecular diagnosis, biosensors,
drug development, and other fields. Operating Principle of RCA The template of
RCA must be circular. If linear genes are amplified, padlock probes are
required. Both ends of the padlock probe have complementary sequences with the
target gene. The target gene is identified by the padlock probe and combined
to form an incompletely closed cyclic oligonucleotide. The combination of the
padlock probe and the target gene can form a more stable topology to ensure
the stability of the connection product, and then a fully closed cyclic
oligonucleotide is formed under the action of the ligase. If the template
itself is a cyclic single-stranded oligonucleotide, this process is not
required. The two most common amplification processes are described below.
Linear amplification : the positive primer recognizes the pairing sequence of
the circular template, and under the action of phi29 DNA polymerase, the
repetitive linear single-stranded DNA sequence is synthesized. This single-
stranded DNA contains hundreds or thousands of repetitive template
complementary fragments. Exponential amplification : On the basis of linear
amplification, a reverse primer is added. This primer can combine with a
linear single-stranded DNA sequence. Under the function of phi29 DNA
polymerase's strand displacement, it can form a multi-branch amplification
reaction, making the product increase exponentially. Important Components of
RCA Primers Padlock probe : It has a complementary sequence with the target
gene and combines with the target gene to form an incomplete closed loop.
Forward primer: Identify the pairing sequence of the circular template and
conduct linear amplification of RCA. Reverse primer: Identify the linear
single-stranded sequence of linear amplification product and conduct RCA
exponential amplification. Enzymes DNA ligase: connect the two ends of the
incomplete lock ring to form a completely closed circular template. phi29 DNA
polymerase: Thermostable DNA polymerase cloned from Bacillus subtilis phage
phi29 , characterized by strong strand displacement activity and continuous
synthesis reaction. Key Points of RCA The RCA detection template should be a
single-stranded circular structure. If it is linear DNA, it should be
cyclized. For circular RNA templates, RNA reverse transcription is not
required. phi29 DNA polymerase can catalyze DNA polymerization at room
temperature, so RCA can react at 30°C or room temperature. The amplification
efficiency of linear amplification can reach 10 5 times, and that of
exponential amplification can reach 10 9 times. RCA has high specificity and
is suitable for SNP detection. The products obtained from the phosphorylation
of RCA products can be directly used for sequencing. Solutions of SBS Genetech
phi29 HT DNA polymerase phi29 HT DNA polymerase phi29 HT DNA polymerase is an
updated version of phi29 DNA polymerase. In addition to the strong strand
displacement and continuous synthesis (> 70kb) activity of phi29 DNA
polymerase, phi29 HT DNA polymerase can continuously synthesize DNA at 42°C,
while the activity of phi29 DNA polymerase is very low at this temperature. In
addition, phi29 HT DNA Polymerase still has a strong 3 '- 5' exonuclease
proofreading function and the fidelity of the synthesized DNA fragments is
high. The exonuclease activity of this enzyme is strong, so the primer needs
3'- end thio-modification in the process of synthesis to reduce the cleavage
effect of the exonuclease activity on the primer. The high-temperature
reaction characteristic of phi29 HT DNA Polymerase has the following
advantages: In the next generation sequencing (NGS), the enzyme has stronger
amplification activity for complex templates such as high GC content and
palindrome structure, which makes the coverage of NGS more uniform and reduces
the depth required for sequencing. High-temperature reaction conditions
improve the synthesis of WGA products of genomic DNA and can be used for
variable temperature amplification. The gap region in sequencing is reduced,
which can improve the quality and integrity of the data from single-cell
sequencing. Reduce non-specific amplification products. Improve the
amplification performance and specificity of MDA/RCA and other experiments.
Custom DNA Oligonucleotides For single-stranded linear oligonucleotides, the
most important part of the cyclization process is the design of the padlock
probe. The two ends of the padlock probe are specifically complementary to the
target gene sequence. When there is a mismatch, the probe connection cannot be
completed. High-quality probes can ensure the high specificity of DNA/RNA
amplification. At SBS Genetech, we provide guidance on the design of the
padlock probe and combines it with the unique primer synthesis platform of RCA
to ensure the formation of a high-quality cyclic oligonucleotide template for
the amplification reaction. Besides, SBS Genetech is recognized as one of the
global major leading industry players in Oligonucleotide Synthesis by third-
party market researchers. For more details, please visit DNA Oligonucleotide

Why is Bst polymerase used in LAMP? - Isothermal Amp Return to site Return to
site Why is Bst polymerase used in LAMP? Delve deeper into the diverse range
of Bst polymerase variants developed by SBS Genetech, each uniquely engineered
to meet the demands of specific research objectives. March 23, 2024 ·
Isothermal Amp BST (Bacillus stearothermophilus) polymerase, commonly known as
Bst polymerase, is a staple in Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP)
for its tailored features that align perfectly with this technique: High
Thermal Stability: Bst polymerase boasts exceptional stability at elevated
temperatures, a must for LAMP reactions held consistently between 60°C to
65°C. This resilience allows it to endure the prolonged high temperatures
needed for DNA denaturation, annealing, and extension during amplification.
Robust Strand Displacement Activity: With robust strand displacement activity,
Bst polymerase efficiently displaces DNA strands ahead of the polymerization
process, streamlining DNA amplification without the need for thermal cycling.
This trait is vital for the continuous amplification nature of LAMP, where
displaced DNA strands act as templates for further amplification.
Amplification of Complex Templates: Bst polymerase excels in amplifying DNA
templates with intricate secondary structures, like hairpins or loops, often
encountered in LAMP reactions. Its robust strand displacement activity helps
navigate through these structures, ensuring efficient amplification of target
sequences. Isothermal Amplification Competence: Operating as an isothermal
amplification technique, LAMP functions at a constant temperature without
requiring complex thermal cycling equipment. Bst polymerase's ability to
operate optimally at a single, constant temperature simplifies experimental
setup, reducing reliance on sophisticated thermal cycling instruments, thus
making LAMP accessible for various applications, including field-based
diagnostics. Cost-effectiveness: In contrast to other DNA polymerases used in
PCR-based techniques, Bst polymerase is relatively inexpensive, making it an
attractive option for large-scale or resource-limited applications, such as
point-of-care diagnostics or field-based testing. In summary, BST polymerase's
unique blend of thermal stability, robust strand displacement activity, and
isothermal amplification capability positions it as an optimal enzyme for
LAMP, enabling swift and sensitive detection of target nucleic acid sequences
across various applications in research, diagnostics, and biotechnology. At
SBS Genetech, we've developed a range of novel Bst polymerase variants
tailored to enhance their utility in LAMP. Let's explore these innovative
solutions further. Bst DNA Polymerase Large Fragment: Cost-effective version
for conventional strand displacement reaction Bst DNA Polymerase Large
Fragment is the portion of the Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA Polymerase
protein that contains the 5´ → 3´ polymerase activity, but lacks 5´ →3´
exonuclease activity. It has basic strand displacement activity and can be
used for isothermal amplification. However, without further genetic
engineering, the amplification speed, impurity tolerance, and specificity of
Bst DNA Polymerase (Large Fragment) are not ideal. So we don't recommend this
enzyme for most of your experiments. Bst DNA Polymerase: Ideal for isothermal
amplification of DNA template Bst DNA Polymerase is also derived from Bacillus
stearothermophilus DNA polymerase I. Its 5 '- 3' exonuclease activity was
removed by genetic engineering, while the 5 '- 3' polymerase activity was
retained. As the name suggests, Bst DNA Polymerase has a strong strand-
displacement ability for DNA template, so it is an excellent enzyme for
isothermal amplification. Compared with wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large
fragment), Bst DNA Polymerase has been greatly improved in terms of
amplification speed, yield, salt tolerance, and thermal stability. At the same
time, Bst DNA Polymerase can be amplified with dUTP as substrate, while Bst
DNA Polymerase (Large Fragment) has no such activity. Bst Polymerase: For
isothermal amplification of both DNA and RNA template with a single enzyme
system Bst Polymerase is also derived from Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA
polymerase I. Its 5'- 3' and 3'-5' exonuclease activity was removed by genetic
engineering, while the 5'- 3' polymerase activity was retained. Compared with
wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large fragment) and Bst DNA Polymerase , Bst
Polymerase has better isothermal amplification activity and stronger reverse
transcription activity. Single enzyme system reaction can be realized in the
isothermal amplification experiment with RNA as a template. Bst Polymerase has
good reverse transcription activity at 60-65°C, which can effectively solve
the reverse transcription of the RNA template with secondary complex
structure, while Bst DNA Polymerase and wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large
fragment) do not have this activity. Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase: Ideal for
isothermal amplification of RNA template Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is a mixture
of Bst Polymerase and extremely thermostable reverse transcriptase (65°C
tolerant), which is suitable for the isothermal amplification reaction of RNA.
It can detect low-sensitivity RNA molecules. Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is
suitable for isothermal amplification reaction of both DNA and RNA templates,
which can detect low-sensitivity nucleic acid templates with great efficiency
and specificity. Besides, with a special preparation process, this enzyme has
a fast amplification rate and high tolerance to impurity. Since Bst DNA/RNA
Polymerase is extremely thermostable and also provides sensitive reverse
transcriptase activity, it is reported to have higher sensitivity at high Ct
values. [1] Bst P DNA/RNA Polymerase: The most advanced enzyme solution Bst P
DNA/RNA Polymerase is an upgraded version of Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase through
enzyme electronic re-structure and evolution screening (in silico Design & in
vitro Evolution), which is generally used for LAMP or RT-LAMP amplification of
DNA or RNA. Performance improvements include: The whole Bst P DNA/RNA System
includes hot start Aptamer, which ensures that the enzyme activity blocking
efficiency is >95% at <30°C, and the enzyme activity is completely released
within 1 min at >60°C. This characteristic facilitates the establishment of
the reaction system at room temperature and greatly reduces the non-specific
amplification at low temperatures. The reaction temperature is further raised
to 70°C, which greatly reduces the formation of primer dimer, improves the
amplification specificity, and makes the nucleic acid release of crude samples
more sufficient. The whole portfolio contains Helicase, so Premium LAMP
amplification (pLAMP) is allowed without using F3/B3 primers. At the same
time, Helicase has the function of assisting in strand unwinding, which
further reduces the concentration of FIP/BIP primers. This will further reduce
non-specific amplification and greatly improve amplification homogeneity.
Comparison between the most common Bst DNA Polymerase and the latest Bst P
DNA/RNA Polymerase In conclusion, the selection of a Bst polymerase variant
hinges on your research objectives, with each offering distinct capabilities
and benefits. We trust this comprehensive overview will guide you in selecting
an enzyme that seamlessly aligns with your research pursuits. At SBS Genetech,
our diverse array of Bst polymerases is meticulously curated to meet your
varied requirements. Reference [1] Lu S, Duplat D, Benitez-Bolivar P, León C,

PCR MasterMix is an optimized ready-to-use PCR mastermix, providing several
advantages such as rapidity and simplicity, high sensitivity and specificity,
and good stability. This mastermix contains all the necessary components for
PCR, excluding the DNA template and primers. Taq DNA Polymerase, included in
the 2× Taq PCR MasterMix, lacks 3'→5' exonuclease activity, making it ideal
for amplifying DNA fragments that are less than 6 kb in length. Moreover, the
resulting PCR product possesses an "A" base at the 3' terminal, making it
extremely convenient for cloning into T-vectors. Our 2× Taq PCR MasterMix also
incorporates high-performance PCR enhancers and stabilizers, suitable for both
standard PCR reactions and more complex templates such as those with high GC
content or secondary structures. The utilization of various PCR enhancers and
stabilizers has enabled the development of an efficient and stable pre-
prepared PCR mix. This not only simplifies operational procedures, reduces
contamination, significantly decreases labor intensity and sampling errors,
but also enhances the specificity of PCR reactions. Additionally, the product
design relaxes the requirements for PCR conditions, allowing for the
amplification of templates with as few as 2 copies, resulting in more precise
experimental outcomes. Our 2× Taq PCR MasterMix is available in two
formulations: with or without dye. The dye-containing PCR MasterMix allows for
direct electrophoresis after PCR without the need to add loading buffer. This
feature further improves the efficiency and convenience of experiments.

(for 4*1ml) Description Nucleic Acid Mass Spectrometry (NAMS) is a multi-PCR
analysis and detection system developed based on MALDI-TOF MS mass
spectrometry, which has emerged as a new molecular diagnostic platform
following PCR and NGS in recent years. While fluorescence quantitative PCR
detection is fast, its throughput is limited, unable to conveniently meet the
detection requirements for dozens to hundreds of gene loci. High-throughput
sequencing, although with extremely high throughput, entails high detection
costs, long project detection cycles, and requires professional analysis and
interpretation of the data, thus posing high technical barriers. NAMS, on the
other hand, provides stable and accurate detection results at lower costs,
meeting the demands for qualitative and quantitative detection of medium-
throughput SNP loci and gene mutations. It also facilitates convenient DNA
methylation and copy number variation (CNV) detection, highlighting its strong
competitiveness in the field of genetic testing, thus becoming one of the main
platforms driving rapid development in life sciences, especially in clinical
diagnostics. Nucleic Acid Mass Spectrometry primarily achieves nucleic acid
detection through multiplex PCR, high-throughput chips, and time-of-flight
mass spectrometry. This technology enables simultaneous detection of dozens or
even hundreds of target markers in a single sample, with the capacity to
process over 1000 samples per day. The main steps of NAMS are as follows:
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR): Design upstream and downstream primers for
the target loci, use sample DNA as a template, and perform PCR to obtain PCR
product fragments containing the target loci. Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase
(SAP) treatment: Add SAP to dephosphorylate the PCR products, eliminating
residual dNTPs in the reaction system. Single Nucleotide Extension Reaction:
Add single nucleotide extension primers and a mixture of extension terminators
(ddNTPs) to perform single nucleotide extension reactions. Resin purification:
Add desalting resin to desalt and purify the extension products, avoiding
interference from salt ion peaks in the mass spectrometry results. Sample-
matrix binding: Spot the sample onto a chip with a matrix and perform mass
spectrometry detection, resulting in different detection peak spectra for
different gene fragments. The core technology of NAMS lies in the single
nucleotide extension technique, relying on ddNTPs as extension terminators. By
analyzing the extension products formed during single nucleotide extension
reactions, the aim is to analyze the nucleotide sequence. Currently, the
resolution of NAMS instruments on the market is around 10 Da. During single
nucleotide extension, the molecular weight difference between regular ddATP
and ddTTP is slightly less than 10 Da, making it impossible for the mass
spectrometer to accurately identify A and T, leading to detection failure.
This technical challenge has become one of the barriers limiting the clinical
application of NAMS. To overcome this technical barrier, SBS Genetech has
dedicated efforts to research and development, finally overcoming the
modification of ddNTPs for NAMS, and proudly introducing the specialized
Termination-ddNTP (for MALDI-TOF MS) product! The molecular weight differences
between the modified ddNTPs (for MALDI-TOF MS) are all greater than the
resolution of the mass spectrometer (10 Da), enabling NAMS instruments to
accurately identify A, T, C, and G, ensuring the accuracy of detection.
Features Nucleic Acid Mass Spectrometry Specific : This product is tailored
for MALDI-TOF MS applications, ensuring accuracy in mass spectrometry
detection with molecular weight differences between modified ddNTPs exceeding
10 Da! High Purity : HPLC>99% Stability : Exhibits excellent inter-batch
stability, supported by a rigorous quality management system. Residue-free :
Completely devoid of DNase and endonuclease residues, as well as any remnants
of human or bacterial genomes. Storage Store at -20°C, effective for two
years. Precaution Can be thawed at room temperature. After thawing, it is
advisable to store it in a cooler or in an ice bath. After use, it should be
promptly stored at -20°C. During the experimental process, please use DNase-
free and RNase-free tips and centrifuge tubes. This product is intended for
scientific research by professionals only and is not intended for clinical
diagnosis or treatment. It must not be used for food or drugs and must not be

Integrity Strategies to Combat the Invisible Culprit Threatening Nucleic Acid
Analysis February 17, 2024 · PCR-Related Ever found yourself scratching your
head over mysterious target bands in the blank control of your conventional
PCR? Or perhaps pondering the appearance of Ct values in your qPCR
experiments' no-template controls (NTC)? Maybe you've experienced a
frustrating bout of contaminated results despite replacing reagents and
samples multiple times. If so, you're not alone. Many molecular biology
laboratories grappling with PCR and qPCR have encountered such confounding
situations. But fear not, it's not necessarily a flaw in your reagents or
enzymes. The likely culprit? Aerosol contamination! You might think aerosol
contamination isn't a big deal for nucleic acid experiments, but historically,
major nucleic acid contamination incidents have had serious consequences. On
April 18, 2020, The Washington Post broke a major story: contamination issues
in the laboratories of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
led to a delay in the rapid development of testing tools for the novel
coronavirus, causing delays in COVID-19 testing nationwide. Reports indicated
that after the CDC distributed test kits to 26 public health laboratories
across the U.S., 24 of them reported "false-positive" results, prompting
concerns about the test kits. It took CDC officials over a month to resolve
the testing issues, exacerbating delays in the production and distribution of
test kits across the country. Clearly, aerosol contamination can have serious
and sometimes uncontrollable consequences for nucleic acid testing
experiments. This is especially true for highly sensitive nucleic acid
detection assays like RT-qPCR, where even slight contamination can affect the
accuracy of results. So, what exactly is aerosol contamination, and how does
it affect PCR experiments? Aerosol contamination refers to the dispersion and
suspension of solid or liquid particles in a gas medium, potentially including
biological agents like bacteria or viruses. In laboratories where sensitive
nucleic acid detection assays like RT-qPCR are commonplace, aerosol
contamination poses a significant threat to the accuracy of results. Even
minor contamination can skew Ct values, leading to erroneous assessments of
gene content in samples. But how does aerosol contamination occur in the first
place? Friction between gases and liquids can generate aerosols, and in busy
labs where multiple individuals handle the same reagents and equipment, the
risk of contamination skyrockets. For instance, using shared equipment like
pipettes and centrifuges, conducting PCR procedures in close proximity, or
even simply mixing samples in the same area can introduce contaminants. This
can manifest as false positives in blank controls during gel electrophoresis
or unexpected bands in qPCR assays. So, how can laboratories mitigate the risk
of aerosol contamination? Utilize UDG contamination prevention reagents :
Aerosols may harbor copy numbers ranging from 10^4 to 10^6 copies. Hence, even
minute traces of contamination can potentially yield false-positive outcomes
in experiments. Nevertheless, by employing a qPCR premix equipped with a UDG
contamination prevention system, such as Probe qPCR Mix (2X, UDG) , the
likelihood of contamination stemming from your amplification products can be
greatly mitigated. Implement standard laboratory layout setups : Many
laboratories often perform fluorescence quantitative detection experiments
without adequately considering the necessity for proper nucleic acid
amplification area divisions. A well-thought-out laboratory layout can
significantly decrease the risk of nucleic acid contamination. Essentially, a
testing laboratory should incorporate the following designated areas: a
reagent storage and preparation area, a sample preparation area, and an
amplification and product analysis area, each physically separated from one
another. Pass-through windows should adhere to sealing standards and must
prevent direct airflow between areas. Enforce unidirectional flow for
personnel and items : In theory, the movement of personnel and materials
should adhere to a unidirectional flow, starting from the reagent storage and
preparation area, through the sample preparation area, amplification area, and
finally to the product analysis area. This arrangement minimizes the potential
for sample cross-contamination. However, in crowded laboratory settings unable
to maintain this ideal flow, instruments and consumables such as pipettes,
centrifuges, nucleic acid extractors, PCR machines, opened reagent boxes, and
tip boxes require regular treatment with nucleic acid decontaminants to
eradicate any residual nucleic acid contamination. Adopt standardized storage
practices : To mitigate the risk of reagents being opened repeatedly,
potentially leading to contamination with the genes under examination and
compromising the efficacy of subsequent reagent use, it's advisable to divide
reagents into smaller aliquots for storage. This practice minimizes the
likelihood of aerosol contamination resulting from frequent reagent openings.
Particularly for positive samples, ensuring tight sealing of caps is crucial,
thereby reducing the possibility of sample exposure to the environment.
Standardize experimental procedures : PCR products undergo multiple rounds of
amplification, resulting in copy numbers far exceeding the detection limit of
PCR. Therefore, during operations, movements should be slow and gentle to
minimize the risk of aerosol contamination. When aspirating samples using a
pipette, it's imperative to strictly adhere to the principle of slow
aspiration and slow dispensing. After centrifuging to mix samples, it's
advisable to wait a moment before opening the lid to prevent the gas in the
reaction tube from carrying sample genes into the air. Prior to gel
electrophoresis after PCR, if there are indications of loosened caps on the
reaction tubes within the strip or if the liquid level in the tubes decreases
post-PCR, it's crucial to recognize that cross-contamination may have occurred
between tubes or within the PCR machine itself. This scenario often manifests
in reaction tubes positioned near the edges of the strip. The aforementioned
sources of nucleic acid contamination can all contribute to the dispersion of
aerosols into the air or direct adsorption onto surfaces. Heavy contamination
may yield false-positive Ct values around 24, while moderate contamination
could lead to values around 30, and light contamination may result in values
around 33. Therefore, rather than attributing blame solely to reagents, it is
imperative to concentrate on minimizing aerosol contamination to guarantee
precise and dependable outcomes in our PCR endeavors! Subscribe Previous

temperatures (below 31°C), but its activity is enhanced at 50°C, making it
suitable for reactions at higher temperatures. RNase H Deficient : This
reverse transcriptase is a variant with RNase H activity deficiency, which
helps prevent RNA degradation, improving the efficiency and stability of cDNA
synthesis. Utilizes Nucleic Acid Adapter Technology : It covalently binds to
M-MLV using nucleic acid adapter technology, increasing its specificity and
reducing the risk of nonspecific synthesis. Enhanced Product Specificity : By
inhibiting M-MLV activity at lower temperatures, this enzyme enhances product
specificity, aiding in obtaining more accurate cDNA products. Greater
Extension Capability : Through genetic engineering modifications, the optimal
reaction temperature of this reverse transcriptase has been raised to 50°C,
enhancing its extension capability, making it suitable for longer cDNA
synthesis reactions. Related: Mutant M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase Thermo-stable

Inhibitor) $20.00 - $75.00 Murine RNasin (RNase Inhibitor) is an RNase
inhibitor obtained by recombinant protein expression. It can non-covalently
bind with RNase A, B, and C to form a 1:1 complex. It has a broad spectrum of
RNase inhibitory activity and can protect RNA from degradation at temperatures
up to 55°C. Compared with the human RNase inhibitor, the murine RNase

endonuclease activity of MutH, and cooperate with helicase and single-strand
binding protein to remove the mismatched sequence. Tth MutL protein is a DNA
mismatch repair protein isolated from Thermus thermophilus. It has DNA-
dependent ATPase activity in the optimal temperature range of 65-75°C. The Tth
MutS protein recognizes the loop structure formed by mismatched bases and
inserted bases in DNA replication, and it tightly binds to the loop structure

ADVANCES (IF: 15)! This study reveals the suppressive role of FoxA1 in liver
cancer and identifies IKBKE as a key regulator, offering a promising strategy
for targeted therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma. · Publications, News
Physiologically, FoxA1 plays a key role in liver differentiation and
development, and pathologically exhibits an oncogenic role in prostate and
breast cancers. However, its role and upstream regulation in liver
tumorigenesis remain unclear. On February 7, 2024, Jianping Guo, Lixia Xu, Wei
Xie from Sun Yat-sen University, and Ying Liang from Guangzhou Medical
University, co-corresponding authors, published a research paper titled
"Atypical inflammatory kinase IKBKE phosphorylates and inactivates FoxA1 to
promote liver tumorigenesis" online in Science Advances (impact factor:
14.98). This study demonstrated the suppressive role of FoxA1 in liver cancer.
Using a CRISPR-based kinome screening approach, they found that the
noncanonical inflammatory kinase IKBKE can inhibit FoxA1's transcriptional
activity. It is noteworthy that IKBKE directly binds to and phosphorylates
FoxA1, reducing its complex formation and DNA interaction, resulting in an
increase in hepatocellular malignancies. Knock-in mice with non-phosphorylated
mimic Foxa1 significantly delayed liver tumor occurrence in hydrodynamic
transfection murine models, while knock-in mice with phospho-mimic Foxa1
phenocopied Foxa1 knockout mice, exhibiting developmental defects and liver
inflammation. Importantly, Ikbke knockout delayed the development of
diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver tumors in mice. In summary, this study
not only reveals FoxA1 as a bona fide substrate and negative nuclear effector
of IKBKE in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but also provides a promising
strategy to target IKBKE for HCC therapy. DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adk2285 In

ROX) Description Probe qPCR Mix (2X, UDG) is a new high-quality carryover
prevention premix for real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR based on probes
such as TaqMan. It is designed for ultra-sensitive specific quantitative
detection of cDNA and genomic DNA, among others. This product contains an
optimized ratio of high-quality UDG enzyme and dUTP, effectively eliminating
false positives or abnormally low CT values caused by contamination from PCR
products. As the probe commonly used is the TaqMan probe, this method is also
frequently referred to as the carryover prevention TaqMan probe method. UDG
(Uracil-DNA Glycosylase), also known as UNG (Uracil-N-glycosylase), catalyzes
the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond between the uracil (dU) base and
deoxyribose in the DNA chain containing uracil, thus releasing free uracil. It
is mainly used to eliminate contamination issues caused by PCR amplification.
The mechanism for preventing contamination is: adding an appropriate amount of
dUTP to the PCR reaction, incorporating dUTP instead of dTTP into the DNA to
produce PCR amplification products containing the dU base. In subsequent PCR
reactions, the UDG enzyme selectively cuts the single or double-stranded DNA
that may have been contaminated from previous PCR amplification containing dU,
thereby avoiding potential contamination effects on the current PCR
amplification. This product is particularly suitable for the quantitative or
qualitative detection of low abundance or highly specific target genes.
Examples include high sensitivity detection of low abundance mRNAs, lncRNAs,
small RNAs, microbial RNA post-transcription, and SNP detection of homologous
genes or genes that are hard to differentiate using conventional dye methods
due to high similarity. Principle Probe-based qPCR does not use fluorescent
dyes like SYBR Green to stain PCR products. Instead, it employs a DNA probe
labeled with a fluorescent group and a quenching group (quencher) targeting
the sequence intended for PCR detection (the designed probe binding site
typically lies between the two primer binding sites). Normally, the quencher
on the probe quenches the fluorescent group due to spatial fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET). During PCR reaction amplification of the
target sequence, both the primer and the probe anneal to the target gene. As
the primer extends, the 5'→3' exonuclease activity of the Taq enzyme results
in the probe bound to the target sequence being gradually degraded from the 5'
end. Once the Taq enzyme cleaves the fluorescent group and the quencher of the
probe, the quenching effect disappears, and the fluorescent group can be
excited by the excitation light to produce fluorescence. With each PCR cycle,
more fluorescent groups are released, and the fluorescence intensity is
proportional to the number of newly synthesized target fragments, enabling
quantitative detection. Probes are typically a linear DNA sequence specific to
the target sequence, labeled with a fluorescent group like FAM or HEX at the
5' end and a quenching group like BHQ1, TAMRA, or MGB at the 3' end. Features
High specificity and sensitivity : Specificity depends not only on the PCR
primers but also on the specificity of the probe. Only when the probe
specifically binds and degrades with the target gene will a fluorescent signal
be generated. The detection sensitivity and specificity are generally much
higher than methods using fluorescent dyes like SYBR Green. For multiplex
detection : in a single reaction well, different genes correspond to different
probes, and different probes correspond to different fluorescent labels,
enabling multiplex fluorescent quantitative PCR detection. Testing has shown
that after appropriate optimization of primers and probes, this product can be
used to detect 2-3 genes simultaneously. Hotstart property : The Hotstart Taq
DNA Polymerase used in this product is a high-quality heat-start enzyme bound
to an antibody. It allows for convenient and efficient heat activation. In the
Hotstart Taq DNA Polymerase, the Taq enzyme binds with a monoclonal antibody
against the Taq enzyme, inhibiting its DNA polymerase activity, which
effectively prevents non-specific annealing of primers and template DNA or
primer dimerization at low temperatures. The antibody is heat-inactivated
during the pre-denaturation step of the PCR reaction, ensuring that Taq enzyme
activity is only released after pre-denaturation, avoiding DNA polymerization
reactions before pre-denaturation, greatly enhancing the specificity,
sensitivity, and quantitative detection accuracy of the PCR reaction. Easy to
use : This product includes all common components like Hotstart Taq DNA
Polymerase, UDG enzyme, PCR Buffer, dNTPs, dUTP, stabilizers, and magnesium
ions, making the process simpler and more convenient for users. Users only
need to prepare primers, probes, sample DNA, and deionized water. ROX Dye The
role of ROX dye is to correct fluorescence fluctuations unrelated to PCR,
thereby minimizing inter-well variability. This variation might be caused by
factors such as pipetting errors and sample evaporation. Different
quantitative PCR instruments have varying requirements for ROX. Depending on
the specific instrument in use, one should choose a Probe qPCR Mix (2X, UDG)
containing either a high concentration of ROX (High ROX), a low concentration
of ROX (Low ROX), or no ROX. Typically, the Probe qPCR Mix containing a high
concentration of ROX can also be used for fluorescence quantitative PCR
instruments that don't require ROX or require a low concentration of ROX.
Storage Store at -20ºC in a dark place, effective for one year; Store at 4ºC
in the dark, effective for one month. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Precautions The choice of fluorescence label for the probe should be
determined based on the fluorescence compatibility of the qPCR instrument
being used. For fluorescent quantitative PCR machines that require ROX as a
correction dye, avoid using probes labeled with ROX. When used for multiplex
detection, it is necessary to properly optimize the primers and probes, and
use appropriately differently labeled fluorescence probes. After determining
the results, proceed with multiplex detection, and it is generally recommended
not to exceed triplex detection. If used for triplex or quadruplex detection,
Multiplex Probe qPCR Mix (2X, UDG) is recommended. Before use, ensure that the
entire tube of reagent is completely melted. Invert gently to mix before
using. Try to avoid producing bubbles during the mixing process. Pay attention
to the primer annealing temperature. When the annealing temperature is <60ºC,
it is recommended to use a three-step PCR amplification. For amplification
fragments exceeding 350bp or with a high GC content, it is suggested to extend
the time to 60 seconds or use the three-step method to improve the
amplification efficiency. It has been tested that the product can withstand up
to 10 freeze-thaw cycles without significant impact on its efficacy. However,
it is still advised to avoid repeated freeze-thawing as this could potentially
degrade the product's performance. qPCR detection is an ultra-sensitive
method. Although this product has excellent contamination prevention, the PCR
reaction setup area should still avoid any potential contamination by
amplicons. PCR products should be sealed and discarded to prevent high-
concentration PCR products from contaminating the experimental environment.
This product is intended for scientific research by professionals only. It
should not be used for clinical diagnosis or treatment, and is not to be used
in food or drugs, nor should it be stored in regular residences. For your

Reactions Navigating Internal and External Variables for Successful PCR
Amplification February 19, 2024 · PCR-Related PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)
stands as a cornerstone technique in molecular biology, empowering a wide
array of applications ranging from gene detection to pathogen identification.
Yet, the efficacy of PCR assays can be compromised by inhibitory factors that
lurk within the reaction milieu. These inhibitory factors may emanate from
both internal components and external contaminants, posing challenges to the
accuracy and reliability of PCR results. Internal Factors in PCR Reactions 1\.
Primer Design: PCR primers, synthesized custom DNA oligonucleotides , play a
pivotal role in determining the specificity and efficiency of PCR
amplification. The success of PCR largely depends on adhering to certain
principles in primer design. Optimal Primer Length : Primers typically range
from 15 to 30 nucleotides in length. Excessively long primers hinder binding
to the template and may form secondary structures, while overly short ones
compromise specificity. Appropriate GC Content : The GC content of primers
should ideally fall within the range of 40% to 60%. Consistency in GC content
between forward and reverse primers is crucial for balanced annealing. Extreme
GC content can impede primer-template annealing. The bases at the 3' end of
the primer generally avoid A/T pairs because A/T pairs have only 2 hydrogen
bonds (compared to 3 in G/C pairs), which relatively increases the efficiency
of mispriming. Additionally, the 3' end should prevent consecutive C or G
bases because continuous GC pairs are detrimental to the binding of the
primer's 3' end with the template. Avoidance of Complementary Sequences :
Primers must not contain complementary sequences to each other or within
themselves. Random distribution of bases is essential to prevent primer dimer
formation, which can interfere with template annealing. Consideration of
Terminal Modifications : While modifications at the 5' end of primers can
enhance specificity, modifications at the 3' end should be avoided as they can
interfere with extension. Modifications at the 5' end include enzyme cleavage
sites, fluorescent or biotin labels, introduction of point mutations,
insertions, deletions, or promoter sequences. Optimal Tm Values : The melting
temperature (Tm) of primer-template pairs should ideally fall between 55°C to
80°C. Consistency in Tm values between forward and reverse primers ensures
balanced annealing, typically not exceeding a 5°C difference. Prevention of
Secondary Structures : Primers should be designed from genomic regions less
prone to forming secondary structures to avoid hindrance in amplification.
Avoidance of Terminator Codons : Terminal primer bases should not correspond
to terminator codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) as the third position of these codons is
prone to degeneracy, affecting amplification specificity and efficiency. 2\.
Primer quality : It's essential to ensure that the oligos are synthesized with
a high coupling efficiency, ideally around 99%. Purification methods such as
RPC, PAGE, or HPLC can further enhance the quality by removing impurities.
High coupling efficiency allows for the synthesis of longer oligos, up to 200
bases, while modifications can be tailored to specific research needs.
Additionally, analyzing oligos through PAGE and employing techniques like
Maldi-Tof Mass QC can provide assurance of their quality and reliability for
PCR applications. These measures collectively contribute to obtaining accurate
and reproducible results in molecular biology experiments. 3\. Enzyme and its
concentration : Excessive enzyme concentration can lead to nonspecific
amplification, while too low a concentration reduces the synthesis of
products. 4\. Quality and concentration of dNTPs : The dNTP solution is
typically acidic, with adjustments made to achieve a pH of 7.0-7.5 during
system preparation. Ideally, under standard conditions, the concentrations of
all four dNTPs should be equal. Deviations from this balance can lead to
issues such as mispriming if one dNTP is excessively high, or reduced PCR
product yield if concentrations are too low. To mitigate these risks, we
recommend opting for a ready-to-use dNTPs mix solution containing dATP, dCTP,
dGTP, and dTTP (monosodium salts) at an identical concentration, dissolved in
sterile deionized water at pH 7.5. This solution should exhibit a purity of
≥99% as determined by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis,
and importantly, it should be free of RNase and DNase contaminants. 5\.
Nucleic acid template : The quantity, purity, and integrity of the template
all affect the PCR reaction. 6\. Mg2+ concentration : Mainly affects the
specificity and yield of PCR amplification, generally corresponding to the
concentration of dNTPs. An excessively high Mg2+ concentration reduces
specificity, leading to nonspecific amplification, while too low a
concentration decreases the activity of Taq DNA polymerase, resulting in
reduced product yield. 7\. Temperature and time settings : PCR involves three
temperature points—denaturation, annealing, and extension—each with its own
time setting. For templates with high GC content, the denaturation time should
be extended. If the primer has a low number of bases, annealing temperature
can be raised slightly to increase PCR specificity; conversely, if the primer
has a high number of bases, annealing temperature can be lowered to facilitate
primer binding to the DNA template. For longer product lengths, extension time
should be extended accordingly. 8\. Number of cycles : The number of cycles
determines the extent of PCR amplification, primarily dependent on the
concentration of template DNA. The more cycles, the higher the amount of
nonspecific products and the higher the rate of base misincorporation.
External Factors in PCR Reactions SDS (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate) : Anionic
detergent that can disrupt the non-covalent bonds (hydrogen bonds and
hydrophobic interactions) of enzyme proteins, binding to the hydrophobic
regions of proteins, thereby denaturing enzyme proteins and causing loss of
their natural conformation and function. A concentration of 0.01% can
completely inhibit PCR reactions, while 0.005% can significantly reduce yield.
Phenol : Organic solvent capable of denaturing enzyme proteins. A
concentration of 0.5% can completely inhibit PCR reactions, while 0.2% can
significantly reduce yield. Ethanol : Organic solvent; concentrations greater
than 1% can inhibit PCR reactions. Isopropanol: Organic solvent slightly
stronger in inhibiting PCR reactions compared to ethanol. Sodium Acetate
(NaAc) : Inhibits PCR reactions at concentrations greater than 5mM. Causes a
decrease in reaction system pH, forming sodium salt complexes with DNA,
leading to precipitation. Sodium Chloride : Inhibits PCR reactions at
concentrations greater than 25mM. EDTA : Metal ion chelator capable of
chelating Mg2+ in the system, inhibiting polymerase activity. A concentration
of 0.5mM reduces PCR product yield, while 1mM completely abolishes PCR
product. Hematin : Hematin is a heme pigment found in higher animals, serving
as the prosthetic group of hemoglobin, present in the color proteins of the
blood, liver, and muscles of higher animals. Inhibits PCR reactions at
concentrations greater than 1mg/ml. Difficult to remove with organic solvent
extraction of DNA, leading to easy residue. Hemin Chloride : Hemin chloride is
hematin's central ion, divalent iron ion, which, in the presence of oxidants
and heating, can be oxidized to trivalent iron ion, forming brown hemin
chloride. Inhibits PCR reactions at concentrations greater than 0.1ng/μl.
Tannic Acid : Tannic acid, also known as tannin acid, is a natural phenolic
organic compound found in plants. Inhibits PCR reactions at concentrations
greater than 0.1ng/μl. Heparin : Inhibits PCR reactions at concentrations
greater than 0.15 IU/ml. Heparin, composed of sulfated D-glucosamine and
D-glucuronic acid, is a viscous polysaccharide containing various sulfate
groups, exhibiting strong acidity. Heparin, associated with its anions, is
related to anticoagulation and thus is a polyionic glycosaminoglycan drug. It
also exists in tissues such as the lungs, vascular walls, and intestinal
mucosa, serving as a natural anticoagulant in animals. Heparin strongly
inhibits MLV reverse transcriptase and Taq DNA polymerase. During nucleic acid
purification, heparin in the sample can bind to DNA and RNA, and subsequent
steps cannot remove this interfering effect of heparin. Urea : Derived from
urine, urea is an organic compound composed of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and
hydrogen. Inhibits PCR at concentrations greater than 20mM. Urea is the final
product of protein metabolism in the body, primarily excreted via filtration
by the kidneys into urine. Humic Acid : Derived from soil, plant materials,
and natural water sources. It may inhibit polymerase activity through
chelation of Mg2+. Humic acid is an organic substance formed by microbial
decomposition of dead matter in the soil, typically black-brown in color,
containing elements necessary for plant growth and development, thus improving
fertility. It constitutes a major part of soil organic matter, typically
accounting for 50-70% of total organic matter. Major elements in humic acid
include carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, etc. Humic
acid is not a single compound but rather a mixture of organic compounds with
commonalities and differences in composition, structure, and properties,
primarily consisting of humic and fulvic acids. Bile Salts : Found in feces.
Bile salts, also known as bile acids, are amphipathic macromolecules derived
from cholesterol in bile, aiding in the digestion and absorption of
cholesterol and fats, leading to elevated blood lipid levels. Bile salts
effectively break down fat tissues and proteins, facilitating the faster
breakdown, absorption, and utilization of these nutrients in the small
intestine. Bilirubin : Bilirubin is a type of bile pigment, the primary
pigment in human bile. It is the major metabolic product of heme compounds in
the body, toxic and capable of irreversible damage to the brain and nervous
system, yet it also functions as an antioxidant, inhibiting the oxidation of
linoleic acid and phospholipids. Bilirubin serves as a critical indicator of
jaundice and liver function clinically. Bilirubin can inhibit Taq enzyme
activity. Hemoglobin : Hemoglobin and its metabolites may interact with Taq
enzyme, inhibiting Taq enzyme activity and significantly reducing PCR
amplification efficiency. This inhibitory effect may be related to the release
of iron ions. Hyperlipidemia : High levels of lipids inhibit Taq enzyme
activity, resulting in reduced amplification efficiency. The interference
mechanism of hyperlipidemia in Real-Time PCR mainly involves the shielding or
absorption of fluorescence by low-density lipoproteins in the blood.
Hyperlipidemia leads to fluorescence quenching, resulting in decreased
fluorescence signal intensity. Studies have shown that the use of low-
temperature high-speed centrifugation can effectively remove interference from
lipemic factors. IgG : The mechanism by which IgG inhibits PCR reactions
involves interaction with single-stranded DNA, preventing target DNA from
binding to DNA polymerase. Moreover, this inhibitory effect is enhanced during
sample heating cycles. Sodium cholate, deoxycholate, taurocholate, iron
chloride, plant complex polysaccharides, melanin, calcium ions, collagen, etc.
PCR Enhancers PCR enhancers are a type of additive that can improve the
sensitivity, specificity, fidelity, and other properties of PCR and PCR-
related techniques. Examples include betaine, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),
formamide, glycerol, PEG, spermine, and single-stranded DNA binding proteins.
However, at high concentrations, they can also inhibit PCR. According to their
functions and principles, they can be roughly divided into three categories:
1\. Used for amplifying templates with high GC content or complex secondary
structures : 1M betaine, 1-10% DMSO, 1-5% formamide, and 1-10% glycerol can
significantly increase the yield for such templates, but excess amounts can
inhibit PCR reactions. Betaine : Betaine, chemically known as
N,N,N-trimethylglycine, is a biogenic amine similar in structure to amino
acids and belongs to the quaternary ammonium compound category. Betaine is
widely present in both animals and plants. Betaine has the ability to disrupt
DNA sequences rich in GC content, improving the yield and specificity of PCR
amplification. Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) : DMSO is a sulfur-containing organic
compound with weak basicity, soluble in both water and organic solvents,
commonly used as an organic solvent. Pure DMSO has a freezing point of
18.45°C, while DMSO with 40% water content does not freeze at -60°C, and when
mixed with water or snow, DMSO generates heat. Therefore, it provides
convenience for making antifreeze for automobiles, brake fluid, and hydraulic
fluid components. 2\. Used to protect the activity and stability of DNA
polymerase In some reactions, additives such as 0.1mg/ml BSA, 0.1-10% gelatin,
or non-ionic detergents can enhance the stability of polymerase and reduce
adsorption of reagents to tube walls. BSA can resist the inhibitory effects of
hemoglobin, melanin, etc. Non-ionic detergents such as Tween-20, NP-40,
TritonX-100 can counteract the inhibitory effects of trace amounts of strong
ionic detergents, such as 0.01% SDS. Trehalose : Trehalose, also known as
mycose, is a non-reducing disaccharide composed of two glucose molecules. It
forms a special protective membrane on the surface of cells under harsh
conditions such as high temperature, extreme cold, or dehydration, effectively
protecting the structure of biomolecules and maintaining the life processes
and biological characteristics of organisms. Trehalose has thermal stability
and heat-activation properties. It can maintain the protein skeleton during
protein denaturation and preserve its natural structure. It has been verified
in various enzymatic reactions in molecular biology, such as cDNA synthesis
involving reverse transcriptase, DNA degradation involving Dnase I, and
restriction enzyme cleavage reactions. Functions: Acts as a PCR enhancer by
lowering the DNA double-stranded melting temperature, maintaining the
stability of Taq DNA polymerase, and improving PCR reaction efficiency.
Neutralizes the inhibitory effects of inhibitors on DNA polymerase,
maintaining PCR amplification efficiency. Acts as an additive in SYBR Green I
real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR, effectively reducing the inhibition
of SYBR Green I on PCR. Acts as a preservative for rare sample genomes or
genomes at very low concentrations. Applications: Acts as an enzyme
stabilizer, maintaining enzyme activity and post-heat activation enzyme
activity. Can be applied in DNA sequencing reaction experiments to enhance the
accuracy of sequencing containing repetitive sequences (multiple consecutive
A's or T's). PCR amplification of complex templates, such as samples with high
GC content. Suitable for reverse transcription reactions of relatively long
cDNA, especially the synthesis of full-length cDNA, to improve library
coverage. Preservative for trace DNA samples. Additive for qRT-PCR reaction
systems to improve reaction performance. BSA and Tween-20 : Trehalose, BSA,
and Tween-20 have anti-inhibitory effects on shrimp shell components and are
commonly used in PCR methods for detecting viruses in shrimp samples.
Additionally, BSA can enhance the resistance of rTth enzyme to biological
samples, and BSA has a high lysine content, which can bind to phenolic
compounds remaining in the nucleic acid extraction process, protecting Taq DNA
polymerase activity and thereby enhancing PCR amplification efficiency. PEG600
and Glycerol : PEG600 and glycerol can increase PCR product yield by enhancing
enzyme thermal stability and protecting enzyme activity. 3\. Used to optimize
primer and template binding The addition of ammonium ions can reduce
mismatches between primers and templates, improving reaction specificity, thus
reducing the requirements for reaction conditions. Therefore, many PCR
reagents contain 10-20mM ammonium sulfate. Tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC)
also plays a similar role. Spermine : Spermine, also known as
tris(aminopropyl)amine hydrochloride, is a polyamine. It is widely distributed
in organisms and is biosynthesized from putrescine (butanediamine) and
S-adenosylmethionine. Spermine can inhibit neuronal synthetase, bind and
precipitate DNA, be used for DNA-binding protein purification, and stimulate
T4 polynucleotide kinase activity. Research has shown that spermine exhibits
significant inhibitory effects on bile salts, urea, and hematin. Spermine
enhances PCR, primarily by promoting the formation of PCR initiation complexes
through promoting the binding of polymerase, primers, and templates.
Micromolar concentrations of spermine significantly enhance the amplification
of plant genomic DNA. Ammonium Sulfate : Ammonium sulfate can optimize the
specific binding of primers to templates, improving PCR specificity. Research
results show that ammonium sulfate has a significant anti-urea inhibitory
effect. 4\. Sources and Mechanisms of PCR Inhibitors in Specimens Endogenous
Sources : Naturally occurring components present in specimens, such as
immunoglobulins, proteases, hemoglobin and its metabolites, lactoferrin in
leukocytes, myoglobin, lipids, mucins, ions, bile salts, polysaccharides, etc.
Exogenous Sources : Inhibitors present in specimen containers or sampling
equipment, such as heparin anticoagulants, glove powder, etc. 1\. Mechanisms
of Inhibition : Interference with cell lysis during nucleic acid extraction :
Incomplete cell lysis leads to inefficient release of nucleic acids,
preventing amplification. For instance, DNA released by boiling methods may
not always fully dissociate from structural or DNA-binding proteins, resulting
in inhibitory effects on amplification. Degradation or encapsulation of
nucleic acids : DNA instability at the primary structure level due to
hydrolysis, non-enzymatic methylation, oxidative damage, and enzymatic
degradation. Nucleases present in cells can degrade nucleic acids. Residual
nucleases in nucleic acid samples can lead to nucleic acid degradation.
Restriction endonucleases produced by microbes are also factors in DNA
degradation. Some bacterial DNAases are heat-stable nucleases, which can
hydrolyze genomic and primer DNA during mid-amplification. Nucleic acids and
primers may fail to amplify due to their inability to bind to DNA polymerase.
Inhibitory effects of proteins, polysaccharides, cell debris, lipids, etc., on
PCR are likely due to their physical encapsulation of DNA, preventing its
contact with the polymerase. The impact of talcum powder on PCR amplification
on latex gloves may be due to its non-specific binding to DNA. Because DNA can
bind to glass, silica, etc., this is also the basic principle of nucleic acid
extraction using silica adsorption methods. Inactivation of heat-stable DNA
polymerase . 2\. Clinical PCR inhibitors : total bilirubin, hemoglobin, IgG,
triglycerides, and heparin. These substances originate from sample components
or processes and can reduce the efficiency of template amplification, leading
to false-negative results in the detection of low-level samples. 3\. Reverse
transcription inhibitors : SDS, EDTA, glycerol, sodium pyrophosphate,
spermine, and guanidinium salts. Washing RNA precipitates with 70% (v/v)
ethanol can remove inhibitors. In conclusion, understanding and controlling
both internal and external factors influencing PCR reactions are crucial for
obtaining reliable results in molecular biology experiments. By adhering to
principles of primer design, ensuring primer and enzyme quality, optimizing
reaction conditions, and mitigating the effects of inhibitors, researchers can
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of PCR-based assays. At SBS Genetech , we
are committed to providing high-quality products and solutions that contribute

Unleashing the Potential of LAMP Technology and Bst Polymerase in Contemporary
Research and Healthcare January 3, 2024 · Isothermal Amp In the vast landscape
of molecular biology, scientists continually strive to develop techniques that
streamline processes, enhance efficiency, and broaden applications. Among
these advancements, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) stands out
as a powerful tool that has revolutionized various fields, from medical
diagnostics to environmental monitoring. This essay delves into the
multifaceted utility of LAMP, exploring its applications across different
domains and its pivotal role in shaping contemporary research and healthcare.
Understanding LAMP and the Bst Enzyme: Within the realm of molecular biology,
the marriage of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with the
Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst) DNA polymerase heralds a paradigm shift in
nucleic acid amplification techniques. The Bst enzyme, celebrated for its
robust thermo-stability and proficient strand displacement activity, serves as
the linchpin in the LAMP process, facilitating rapid and specific
amplification of target sequences. Discovered and meticulously characterized
for its unique enzymatic properties, Bst polymerase exhibits an exceptional
tolerance to elevated temperatures, ensuring enzymatic activity remains
unhindered even in harsh thermal environments. This remarkable thermo-
stability allows LAMP reactions to proceed seamlessly at a constant
temperature, typically maintained between 60-65°C, circumventing the need for
intricate thermal cycling regimes characteristic of traditional PCR methods.
Moreover, Bst polymerase's adeptness at strand displacement, wherein it can
displace existing DNA strands during amplification, further enhances the
efficiency and specificity of LAMP. This intrinsic capability enables the
synthesis of long DNA strands with high fidelity, ensuring accurate
amplification of target sequences without the risk of mispriming or
nonspecific amplification. The synergy between LAMP and Bst polymerase extends
beyond simplifying amplification protocols. It empowers researchers and
diagnosticians with a versatile tool capable of amplifying nucleic acids from
diverse sample types, including crude specimens like saliva, tissue, and
swabs. Furthermore, the ability to perform LAMP reactions at a single,
constant temperature streamlines assay design and execution, making it
amenable to point-of-care applications and resource-limited settings where
access to sophisticated laboratory infrastructure is restricted. Applications
Medical Diagnostics: One of the most prominent applications of LAMP lies in
medical diagnostics, where its rapid, sensitive, and specific nature has
transformed disease detection and monitoring. From infectious diseases to
genetic disorders, LAMP assays have been developed for a wide array of
pathogens and biomarkers. For instance, LAMP has been instrumental in
diagnosing tuberculosis, malaria, HIV, and other infectious diseases, offering
quick and reliable results crucial for timely treatment and containment of
outbreaks. Moreover, its ability to detect low pathogen concentrations makes
it invaluable for early disease detection and surveillance. Point-of-Care
Testing (POCT): In resource-limited or remote settings where access to
sophisticated laboratory infrastructure is limited, LAMP shines as a
cornerstone of point-of-care testing (POCT). Its simplicity, speed, and
minimal equipment requirements make it ideal for on-site diagnostics. Whether
deployed in rural clinics, disaster areas, or mobile healthcare units, LAMP
empowers healthcare providers to deliver rapid and accurate diagnoses, leading
to improved patient outcomes and disease management. Environmental Monitoring
and Food Safety: Beyond the realm of human health, LAMP finds applications in
environmental monitoring and food safety. Environmental surveillance of
waterborne pathogens, agricultural pathogens, and pollutants relies on
sensitive detection methods, and LAMP fits the bill perfectly. Its robustness
in diverse environmental conditions and rapid turnaround time make it
indispensable for monitoring microbial contamination in water sources, food
products, and agricultural samples, safeguarding public health and food
security. Research and Biotechnology: In addition to its diagnostic
applications, LAMP serves as a versatile tool in research and biotechnology.
Its compatibility with various sample types, including blood, saliva, urine,
and environmental samples, facilitates a broad range of research endeavors.
From studying microbial ecology to tracking genetic mutations, LAMP empowers
researchers with a reliable, cost-effective method for nucleic acid

Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification vs PCR - Isother... Return to site
Return to site Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification vs PCR Discover the
fundamental differences between Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP)
and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), including mechanisms, temperature
requirements, and sensitivities February 8, 2024 · Isothermal Amp Loop-
mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
are both methods used for the amplification of DNA, but they differ in their
mechanisms, requirements, and applications. Mechanism: PCR: PCR involves
cycling through different temperatures (denaturation, annealing, and
extension) to amplify specific DNA sequences. It requires a thermal cycler to
control these temperature changes. LAMP: LAMP is an isothermal amplification
technique, meaning it can amplify DNA at a constant temperature, usually
around 60-65°C. LAMP relies on a strand-displacing DNA polymerase and a set of
four to six primers that recognize six to eight distinct regions on the target
DNA sequence. LAMP produces a mixture of stem-loop DNA structures, resulting
in amplification of the target DNA. Temperature Requirement: PCR: Requires
cycling through different temperature steps (typically 95°C for denaturation,
50-65°C for annealing, and 72°C for extension). LAMP: Operates consistently at
a steady temperature, usually within the range of 60-65°C. However, with our
exclusive Premium LAMP amplification (pLAMP) system , this temperature can be
elevated to 70°C, offering distinct advantages. This higher temperature
setting notably diminishes primer dimer formation , enhances amplification
specificity , and ensures more effective release of nucleic acids from crude
samples . Time: PCR: Typically takes around 2-3 hours to complete a reaction,
including the time needed for cycling through different temperature steps.
LAMP: Typically achieves faster results compared to PCR, often concluding
within 30-60 minutes owing to its isothermal nature. With our meticulously
optimized reaction system , this timeframe can be further reduced to as little
as 20 minutes . Equipment: PCR: Requires a thermal cycler to control
temperature changes. LAMP: Can be performed with simpler equipment, such as a
water bath or a heating block, as it operates at a constant temperature.
Specificity: PCR: High specificity due to the requirement for specific primer
annealing. LAMP: Demonstrates remarkable specificity, utilizing multiple
primers targeting distinct regions of the DNA sequence. Through the
integration of helicase, our Premium LAMP amplification (pLAMP) system
eliminates the necessity for F3/B3 primers . Additionally, helicase aids in
strand unwinding, thereby decreasing the concentration of FIP/BIP primers .
This dual function effectively minimizes non-specific amplification , ensuring
superior amplification uniformity. Sensitivity: PCR: PCR is highly sensitive
and can detect low levels of target DNA. LAMP: LAMP is also highly sensitive
and can detect small amounts of target DNA, sometimes even without the need
for DNA purification. Applications: PCR: Widely used in molecular biology
research, clinical diagnostics, forensics, and many other fields. LAMP:
Increasingly used in point-of-care diagnostics, field testing, and resource-
limited settings due to its simplicity, rapidity, and minimal equipment
requirements. In summary, while both PCR and LAMP serve as valuable DNA
amplification techniques, LAMP stands out for its speed, simplicity, and
minimal equipment needs. The Premium LAMP amplification (pLAMP) system
enhances specificity and reduces reaction time even further, rendering it
especially ideal for applications such as point-of-care diagnostics and field
testing. At SBS Genetech , our pioneering spirit drives us to continually
enhance our offerings in l oop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)

Exploring the Four Types of dNTPs: Essential Components... Return to site Return to site Exploring the Four Types of dNTPs: Essential Components of DNA Replication Discover the crucial roles of dNTPs – dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP – in DNA replication, understanding their significance as fundamental components of genetic synthesis August 1, 2023 · PCR-Related DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a crucial molecule for storing genetic information in living organisms, and dNTPs (deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates) are integral components of the DNA replication process. In DNA replication, dNTPs play the vital role of providing nucleotides, allowing the DNA double helix to unwind and form new DNA strands. This article will introduce the four types of dNTPs and their significance in DNA replication. First, let's understand the composition of dNTPs. dNTPs consist of three main parts: a deoxyribose sugar molecule, a nitrogenous base, and three phosphate groups. These components collectively form the molecular structure of dNTPs, enabling them to function in DNA synthesis. The first type of dNTP is dATP, or deoxyadenosine triphosphate. dATP contains the adenine base, one of the four bases in DNA, which pairs with thymine (T) in DNA. During DNA replication, dATP forms hydrogen bonds with T, aiding in the construction of the new DNA strand. The second type is dTTP, or deoxythymidine triphosphate. dTTP contains the thymine base, which complements adenine (A) in DNA. During replication, dTTP is incorporated into the new DNA strand, forming stable hydrogen bonds with A. The third type is dGTP, or deoxyguanosine triphosphate. dGTP contains the guanine base, which pairs with cytosine (C) in DNA. dGTP provides the G base during DNA replication, facilitating the formation of the new DNA strand. The final type is dCTP, or deoxycytidine triphosphate. dCTP contains the cytosine base, which pairs with guanine (G) in DNA. During DNA synthesis, dCTP forms hydrogen bonds with G, promoting the formation of the new DNA strand. In summary, these four types of dNTPs play indispensable roles in DNA replication. They provide the necessary nucleotides for DNA synthesis, allowing the DNA double helix to unwind and form new DNA strands. Therefore, understanding dNTPs is crucial for comprehending DNA replication and its significance in living organisms. Why Choose SBS Genetech dNTPs for PCR?

Description The difference between the HM-Taq DNA Polymerase and the general hot start Taq DNA Polymerase is that the general hot start Taq DNA Polymerase only blocks the polymerase activity before the temperature rise in the first step, while the HM-Taq DNA Polymerase uses the inhibitory ligand to block the substrate-binding site of the HM-Taq DNA Polymerase through temperature regulation. When the temperature is lower than 40°C, an inactive enzyme-inhibitor complex is formed. When the temperature rises to the annealing temperature, the binding balance moves towards the formation of the template-primer complex, so the production of non-specific amplification products in the whole process of PCR amplification is minimized and the accuracy of PCR reaction is greatly improved. The 3' end of PCR product is A, which can be cloned directly with the TA vector. Features Fast process: no additional heating is required for activation. Better control: The enzyme activity is controlled during continuous annealing to achieve the whole process hot start effect. Minimal contamination: There is no protein contamination such as denatured antibodies in the PCR process. Unit Definition One active unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to add 10 nmol deoxynucleotides into acid-insoluble substances with activated salmon sperm DNA as template primer at 74°C and 30 minutes.

Return to site Bst Polymerase vs Taq Polymerase: How to Select the Appropriate
DNA Polymerase? August 15, 2022 · Isothermal Amp The Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) is a staple in many research laboratories worldwide. Central to this
technique is the DNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for amplifying the
genetic material. But with an array of polymerases available, how does one
decide which is the right fit for their experiments? Overview of Common DNA
Polymerases Taq DNA Polymerase Pfu DNA Polymerase sPfu DNA Polymerase HS-Taq
DNA Polymerase HM-Taq DNA Polymerase Klenow Fragment (3´→5´ exo-) KODP DNA
Polymerase phi29 DNA Polymerase Bsu DNA Polymerase (Large Fragment) Bst DNA
Polymerase Large Fragment Bst DNA Polymerase Bst Polymerase Bst DNA/RNA
Polymerase Bst P DNA/RNA Polymerase And more... For those new to the lab
environment, the plethora of polymerase options can be overwhelming. The key
is to align the properties and strengths of each enzyme with the requirements
of the specific experiment. For instance, colony PCR, which doesn't
necessitate high fidelity, is well-suited for Taq DNA Polymerase. Conversely,
for experiments demanding high accuracy, Pfu DNA Polymerase is a prime choice,
boasting a fidelity rate eight times that of Taq DNA Polymerase. By
understanding the unique features and applications of each DNA polymerase,
researchers can ensure they select the enzyme best suited to their
experimental needs. Taq DNA Polymerase: The Cornerstone of PCR Taq DNA
Polymerase is renowned for its thermostability, possessing the unique ability
to endure incubation at temperatures as high as 95°C without significant
degradation or loss of its activity. Comprising a singular polypeptide chain,
this enzyme has a molecular weight of 94 kDa. It operates with a 5'→3' DNA
polymerase activity and notably lacks the 3'→5' exonuclease function. Under
standard conditions, its extension rate is estimated between 2 to 4 kb/min.
The optimal reaction conditions for Taq DNA Polymerase are: Temperature:
70~75°C dNTPs concentration: 100~300 μM Mg 2+ concentration: 2~3 mM pH range:
8.1~9.1 One notable characteristic of this enzyme is its ability to generate
PCR products with 3'-dA overhangs, making it apt for T-A cloning procedures.
In terms of quantity, a 20μl PCR reaction typically requires 1 to 1.5 units of
the enzyme, while a 50μl PCR reaction necessitates 2 to 3 units. At our
laboratory, we have successfully amplified 6 kb Lambda DNA and 2.1 kb Human
genomic DNA using this enzyme. In the vast landscape of molecular biology, Taq
DNA Polymerase stands out as an essential tool in PCR techniques, serving as a
benchmark for its durability and efficiency. Hot-Start Enzymes: A Key to
Minimizing Non-Specific Amplification Taq DNA Polymerase, commonly used in
amplification, can sometimes lead to non-specific amplification. This can
arise from various factors such as template contamination, primer specificity,
buffer system, procedure, or even the Mg2+ concentration. Among these, the
choice of DNA polymerase plays a pivotal role. If non-specific products
persist despite addressing other factors, turning to hot-start enzymes can be
a game-changer. These enzymes can significantly reduce, if not completely
eliminate, the accumulation of undesired products in the system. There are two
primary categories of widely-used hot-start enzymes: 1\. Antibody-modified
hot-start enzymes such as HS-Taq DNA Polymerase . During the DNA denaturation
phase, the antibody undergoes denaturation, releasing the polymerase and
enabling DNA synthesis. HS-Taq DNA Polymerase is adept at preventing non-
specific amplification that may arise from mispriming or primer-dimer
formation during PCR setup. 2\. Synthetic affinity ligand-based enzymes like
HM-Taq DNA Polymerase . This enzyme employs cutting-edge synthetic affinity
ligand technology to reversibly inhibit the activity of Taq DNA Polymerase
based on temperature. Unlike standard hot-start enzymes, which block
polymerase activity only prior to the initial temperature rise, HM-Taq DNA
Polymerase utilizes an inhibitory ligand to obstruct the substrate-binding
site through temperature regulation. Below 40°C, the enzyme and inhibitor form
an inactive complex. However, as the temperature escalates to annealing
levels, the equilibrium shifts in favor of the template-primer complex. This
mechanism minimizes the creation of non-specific amplification products
throughout PCR, enhancing the accuracy of the reaction considerably. In
conclusion, for those grappling with non-specific amplification, hot-start
enzymes present an efficient solution. By understanding the nuances and
benefits of each type, researchers can better tailor their PCR processes for
optimal results. Bst Polymerase: Mastering Constant Temperature Amplification
In the ever-evolving field of molecular biology, the ability to amplify DNA at
constant temperatures presents both a challenge and an opportunity. The Bst
Polymerase family stands at the forefront of this niche, offering unique
enzymatic solutions tailored for a range of applications. Rooted in rigorous
research and enhanced through biotechnological advancements, our suite of Bst
Polymerases is meticulously designed to address diverse amplification needs.
Before delving into the specifics of each variant, let’s take a moment to
understand their foundational strengths and distinctions. We offer five
distinct variants of Bst Polymerase: Bst DNA Polymerase Large Fragment , Bst
DNA Polymerase , Bst Polymerase , Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase , and Bst P DNA/RNA
Polymerase . 1\. Bst DNA Polymerase Large Fragment : This is a recombinant
enzyme, meticulously purified from Escherichia coli expression. The gene for
this polymerase traces back to Bacillus stearothermophilus but has been
refined through selective point mutations to enhance its functionality. It
showcases a 5'→3' DNA polymerase activity and, notably, lacks both 5'→3' and
3'→5' exonuclease functions. This version also stands out for its exceptional
strand displacement capability. 2\. Bst DNA Polymerase (alternative of 2.0) :
Originating from Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA polymerase I, this enzyme
retains its 5'→3' polymerase activity due to genetic engineering that
eliminated its 5'→3' exonuclease function. This modification, coupled with its
pronounced strand-displacement ability, makes it a top choice for isothermal
amplification. When benchmarked against the wild-type Bst DNA polymerase
(large fragment), it exhibits marked advancements in amplification speed,
yield, salt resistance, and thermal stability. 3\. Bst Polymerase (alternative
of 3.0) : Another derivative of Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA polymerase I,
this version is distinct for having both 5'→3' and 3'→5' exonuclease functions
removed while maintaining its 5'→3' polymerase activity. Its strengths lie in
its superior isothermal amplification and potent reverse transcription
capabilities. Notably, it can undertake a single enzyme system reaction in
isothermal amplification experiments using RNA as a template. Operating
optimally between 60-65°C, it excels in transcribing RNA templates with
intricate secondary structures—a feat that its counterparts, Bst DNA
Polymerase and the wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large fragment), cannot
match. 4\. Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase : This is a harmonized blend of Bst
Polymerase and an ultra-thermostable reverse transcriptase, able to withstand
temperatures up to 65°C. Tailored for isothermal amplification reactions
involving RNA, it shines in detecting low-sensitivity RNA molecules. This
makes it the go-to choice for experiments where RNA serves as the template.
Moreover, it’s adept at isothermal amplification of DNA templates as well. 5\.
Bst P DNA/RNA Polymerase : Representing the pinnacle of our offerings, this
variant is a sophisticated iteration of Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase. Developed
through advanced enzyme electronic restructuring and evolution screening (both
in silico design & in vitro evolution), it's predominantly used for LAMP or
RT-LAMP amplifications. Enhancements include: Integration of a hot start
Aptamer ensuring over 95% enzyme activity blockage at temperatures below 30°C,
while releasing full activity within a minute at temperatures above 60°C. This
feature paves the way for setting up the reaction at ambient temperatures and
significantly diminishes non-specific amplifications at lower temperatures. A
heightened reaction temperature up to 70°C, which substantially curbs the
creation of primer dimers, sharpens amplification specificity, and ensures
more comprehensive nucleic acid release from crude samples. Inclusion of
Helicase, enabling Premium LAMP amplification (pLAMP) without the need for
F3/B3 primers. Additionally, Helicase assists in strand unwinding,
subsequently reducing the requisite concentration of FIP/BIP primers, which in
turn minimizes non-specific amplification and notably enhances amplification
uniformity. This comprehensive suite of Bst Polymerases ensures that
researchers and professionals have the right tool for every unique
amplification requirement. High Fidelity Enzymes: The Key to Rapid and Precise
Amplification In molecular experiments where precision is paramount, the
choice of enzymes plays a pivotal role. DNA polymerases like Pfu DNA
Polymerase and KODP DNA Polymerase are the go-to options for those seeking
high fidelity amplification. For projects that demand both unmatched accuracy
and exceptional speed, sPfu DNA Polymerase stands out. Its fidelity is an
impressive 64 times greater than that of Taq DNA Polymerase and 8 times that
of standard Pfu DNA Polymerase. Moreover, with an amplification rate of 10-30
sec/kb, its speed is commendable. Enter the SuperGold™ 1×sPfu MasterMix , an
all-in-one amplification reagent designed for ease and efficacy. Comprising
SuperGold™ sPfu DNA Polymerase (sPfu), dNTPs, dyes, and essential buffers, it
streamlines the PCR process. Users need only introduce their chosen primers
and DNA templates. This adaptability allows the addition of 1 to 10μl of
primers and templates, optimizing the PCR process. By integrating all
necessary components into one mix, it minimizes potential contamination risks
and shaves time off the experimental procedure. An added advantage? The
inclusion of dyes means that post-amplification, samples are electrophoresis-
ready, eliminating an extra step. The resulting amplified products have a
neat, blunt end. The SuperGold™ sPfu DNA Polymerase further accentuates the
promise of precision with a fidelity rate that's a staggering 69 times higher
than Taq DNA polymerase. Such exactness opens the door to cloning extensive
sequences. Simple templates like plasmids and lambda DNA see effective
amplification lengths up to 40 kb with the SuperGold™ High Fidelity PCR
MasterMix. In the case of genomes, the length extends to 20 kb, and for more
intricate fragments like cDNA, up to 10 kb. Speed is yet another feather in
its cap; the SuperGold™ High Fidelity DNA polymerase boasts an extension rate
of 15 sec/kb, quadrupling the pace of Taq DNA polymerase. From high-fidelity
PCR amplification and colony PCR to blunt-end PCR product amplification and
RT-PCR, this product is a versatile tool for a broad spectrum of molecular
applications. Conclusion: Picking the Right Tool for the Task In the realms of
molecular biology and genetic experimentation, selecting the appropriate DNA
polymerase is akin to picking the right tool for a particular task. As
discussed in this review, there's a plethora of DNA polymerases to choose
from, each with its unique advantages, nuances, and applications. For
beginners or those just venturing into PCR methodologies, the multitude of
options might appear daunting. But with an understanding of the basics and the
specific features of each type of polymerase, this vast landscape transforms
from a confusing array into a toolbox filled with specialized tools for
specific tasks. For instance, when prioritizing the amplification of DNA at a
constant temperature, the Bst polymerase family clearly stands out. If high
fidelity coupled with speedy amplification is the need, then the SuperGold™
sPfu DNA polymerase and its derivatives offer unparalleled precision and
efficiency. Similarly, for those struggling with non-specific amplification in
experiments, the nuances of hot start enzymes, be it antibody-modified or
synthetic-affinity-based, can vastly improve result accuracy. The evolution of
DNA polymerases mirrors the progress in molecular biology itself. With each
innovation, with every newly introduced enzyme variant, researchers gain

Amplification Technology The viewpoint of isothermal amplification industry,
invited by APAC CIO Outlook March 30, 2021 · Isothermal Amp, News Recently,
SBS Genetech was invited by APAC CIO Outlook , a digital and print magazine
that identify and profile emerging companies providing cutting edge solutions
to enterprises in APAC, to share the viewpoint of isothermal amplification
industry. Full text reads as follows. SBS Genetech: Leading the Next
Generation Isothermal Amplification Technology SBS Genetech, Published:
2020-03-30 Nucleic acid testing technology has developed rapidly in recent
years, especially in the field of molecular diagnosis. At present, the
mainstream of nucleic acid testing techniques in the market is based on
quantitative PCR technology (qPCR), which features strong specificity and high
sensitivity. This technology can quantitatively detect pathogens and achieve
high-throughput detection. However, the amplification process of qPCR requires
thermal cycling instruments. Due to their large volume, high price and long
reaction time, the application of thermal cycling instruments in grass-roots
units and on-site detection are very limited. Compared with other nucleic acid
testing techniques, isothermal amplification has the advantages of high
sensitivity and rapidity of reaction, and does not need special equipment.
Therefore, isothermal amplification has been considered by many researchers
and scientists as a detection method which may be comparable with qPCR
technology. At SBS Genetech, we are at the forefront of offering solutions for
isothermal amplification based on our world-class platform. Our Bst DNA/RNA
Polymerase is at the core of this platform, which is a mixture of Bst
polymerase and extremely thermostable reverse transcriptase. Bst DNA/RNA
Polymerase is suitable for isothermal amplification reaction of both DNA and
RNA templates, which can detect low-sensitivity nucleic acid templates with
great efficiency and sensitivity. Besides, with special preparation process,
this enzyme has fast amplification rate and high tolerance to impurity. Based
on this special enzyme, we have developed PrimeIamp TM lyophilized isothermal
amplification microbeads series . This series are ready-to-use master mixes,
which can perform the isothermal amplification directly when the templates and
primers are added. With freeze-drying technology, these master mixes are
lyophilized into solid microbeads, which can be transported and stored at room
temperature with great convenience. Combined with different detection
techniques, we have developed three types of microbeads so far: PrimeIAmp™ Red
Lyophilized Isothermal Amplification Microbeads , PrimeIAmp™ HNB Fluorescent
Dye Lyophilized Isothermal Amplification Microbeads , and PrimeIAmp™ SG
Lyophilized Isothermal Amplification Microbeads . PrimeIAmp™ Red Lyophilized
Isothermal Amplification Microbeads combines our world-class isothermal
amplification technology with red-yellow colorimetric visualization technique.
After amplification, the positive samples are yellow, while the negative
samples are red. The results can be directly observed by naked eyes without
any other auxiliary equipment. PrimeIAmp™ HNB Lyophilized Isothermal
Amplification Microbeads utilizes similar strategy. With HNB dye, the positive
samples are sky blue, while the negative samples are violet. PrimeIAmp™ SG
Fluorescent Dye Lyophilized Isothermal Amplification Microbeads is somehow
different as its dye is specially designed for real-time fluorescence
detection. One area of widespread concern about the isothermal amplification
is that with high-speed amplification characteristics, isothermal
amplification will inevitably lead to false positive amplification, especially
when primers are at high concentration. Fortunately, with our optimized
reaction buffer and unique colorimetric visualization and negative control
technique, our platform provides much higher sensitivity and specificity.
Besides, our Bst DNA/RNA polymerase has strong recognition ability to dUTP.
The dTTP needed for amplification reaction can be completely replaced by dUTP,
so the amplification products all contain dUTP. By adding our Heat-Labile
Uracil DNA Glycosylase (HL-UDG), aerosol pollutants will be completely removed
in the initial reaction stage. The HL-UDG can be later inactivated
irreversibly within 3 min at 65℃, which not only eliminates the pollutants,
but also ensures the normal amplification of nucleic acid. Therefore, the
false positive caused by aerosol pollution in the reaction can be greatly
reduced. Isothermal amplification is an emerging field and we are very excited
to be a part of it. Isothermal amplification technology and qPCR technology
have a strong technical complementarity. The advantage of qPCR lies in the
high-throughput testing in the central laboratory, while isothermal
amplification technology is better at real-time and rapid on-site detection.
They are more complementary than competitive. At SBS Genetech, we will keep
pushing the technology forward to meet the needs of scientists and researchers
in both academia and industry with our continuous efforts. You can also find

SBS Genetech: Direct PCR Makes Everything Easier and Fa... Return to site
Return to site SBS Genetech: Direct PCR Makes Everything Easier and Faster The
viewpoint of direct PCR technologies June 13, 2021 · News, PCR-Related Direct
PCR is a direct nucleic acid amplification technique using animal or plant
tissues as template. In many ways, direct PCR works like standard PCR.
However, the main difference is that the specialized buffer used in direct PCR
can be directly used for PCR reaction without the need of nucleic acid
extraction, which has high requirements for the tolerance of the enzyme and
the compatibility of the buffer involved in direct PCR reaction . Although PCR
inhibitors are more or less present in common samples, direct PCR can still
achieve reliable amplification under the action of optimized enzyme and
buffer. While the standard PCR reaction requires high-quality nucleic acid as
the template. If the template contains protein or other impurities, the PCR
reaction will be inhibited. Therefore, with great convenience and robust
amplification, direct PCR is becoming one of the most popular molecular
biology techniques nowadays. The earliest application of direct PCR is in the
fields of animals and plants, such as the blood, tissue and hair of animals,
or the leaves and seeds of plants, to study genotyping, transgenic, plasmid
detection, gene knockout analysis, DNA source identification, species
identification, SNP analysis and other fields. There are some common
characteristics in these fields, that is, the content of target gene is
relatively high, and nucleic acid extraction is troublesome. Therefore, direct
PCR can not only save time, but also save cost. Direct PCR for pathogen
detection is just developed in recent years, especially during the epidemic of
COVID-19. Many researchers in both academia and industry have made great
efforts in this direction. At SBS Genetech, we are at the forefront of
offering innovative solutions for direct PCR. One of the core enzymes is our
PrimeTaq ™ HotStart Direct PCR DNA Polymerase , which has hot start property
and high tolerance to many PCR inhibitors. High tolerance delivers convenience
for DNA amplification by allowing PCR directly from samples without prior DNA
purification. With hot start property, the polymerase is 100% inactive below
50°C and can be completely recovered only after heating at 95°C for 5 min.
Therefore, the system can effectively inhibit non-specific PCR amplification,
greatly improving the specificity and sensitivity. As direct PCR is not only
used in the amplification of DNA template, but also widely used in the reverse
transcription PCR of RNA template, we have also developed the enzyme for
direct PCR of RNA template. Our PrimeTaq ™ HS DP DNA/RNA Polymerase not only
has hot start property and high tolerance to many PCR inhibitors like
PrimeTaq™ HotStart Direct PCR DNA Polymerase, but also has strong RNA template
dependent reverse transcriptase activity, which makes it ideal for the direct
PCR of RNA template. Direct PCR is also useful in real time PCR reaction,
which requires the reaction system to have strong anti-interference ability of
background fluorescence and antagonistic ability to endogenous fluorescence
quenching agents. Both PrimeTaq™ HotStart Direct PCR DNA Polymerase and
PrimeTaq™ HS DP DNA/RNA Polymerase have 5'- 3' exonuclease activity for TaqMan
probe cleavage, and the optimized reaction system has strong anti-interference
ability and antagonistic ability, so a robust real time PCR reaction is
guaranteed. With great convenience and efficiency, direct PCR is becoming
progressively more important as time goes on. At SBS Genetech, we will keep
developing novel tools for direct PCR, contributing to the scientific
community with our best efforts. Subscribe Previous SBS Genetech: Leading the

Return to site Bst Polymerase vs Taq Polymerase: How to Select the Appropriate
DNA Polymerase? August 15, 2022 · Isothermal Amp The Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) is a staple in many research laboratories worldwide. Central to this
technique is the DNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for amplifying the
genetic material. But with an array of polymerases available, how does one
decide which is the right fit for their experiments? Overview of Common DNA

Polymerase Bst P DNA/RNA Polymerase And more... For those new to the lab
environment, the plethora of polymerase options can be overwhelming. The key
is to align the properties and strengths of each enzyme with the requirements
of the specific experiment. For instance, colony PCR, which doesn't
necessitate high fidelity, is well-suited for Taq DNA Polymerase. Conversely,
for experiments demanding high accuracy, Pfu DNA Polymerase is a prime choice,
boasting a fidelity rate eight times that of Taq DNA Polymerase. By
understanding the unique features and applications of each DNA polymerase,
researchers can ensure they select the enzyme best suited to their
experimental needs. Taq DNA Polymerase: The Cornerstone of PCR Taq DNA
Polymerase is renowned for its thermostability, possessing the unique ability
to endure incubation at temperatures as high as 95°C without significant
degradation or loss of its activity. Comprising a singular polypeptide chain,
this enzyme has a molecular weight of 94 kDa. It operates with a 5'→3' DNA
polymerase activity and notably lacks the 3'→5' exonuclease function. Under
standard conditions, its extension rate is estimated between 2 to 4 kb/min.
The optimal reaction conditions for Taq DNA Polymerase are: Temperature:
70~75°C dNTPs concentration: 100~300 μM Mg 2+ concentration: 2~3 mM pH range:
8.1~9.1 One notable characteristic of this enzyme is its ability to generate
PCR products with 3'-dA overhangs, making it apt for T-A cloning procedures.
In terms of quantity, a 20μl PCR reaction typically requires 1 to 1.5 units of
the enzyme, while a 50μl PCR reaction necessitates 2 to 3 units. At our
laboratory, we have successfully amplified 6 kb Lambda DNA and 2.1 kb Human
genomic DNA using this enzyme. In the vast landscape of molecular biology, Taq
DNA Polymerase stands out as an essential tool in PCR techniques, serving as a
benchmark for its durability and efficiency. Hot-Start Enzymes: A Key to
Minimizing Non-Specific Amplification Taq DNA Polymerase, commonly used in
amplification, can sometimes lead to non-specific amplification. This can
arise from various factors such as template contamination, primer specificity,
buffer system, procedure, or even the Mg2+ concentration. Among these, the
choice of DNA polymerase plays a pivotal role. If non-specific products
persist despite addressing other factors, turning to hot-start enzymes can be
a game-changer. These enzymes can significantly reduce, if not completely
eliminate, the accumulation of undesired products in the system. There are two
primary categories of widely-used hot-start enzymes: 1\. Antibody-modified
hot-start enzymes such as HS-Taq DNA Polymerase . During the DNA denaturation
phase, the antibody undergoes denaturation, releasing the polymerase and
enabling DNA synthesis. HS-Taq DNA Polymerase is adept at preventing non-
specific amplification that may arise from mispriming or primer-dimer
formation during PCR setup. 2\. Synthetic affinity ligand-based enzymes like
HM-Taq DNA Polymerase . This enzyme employs cutting-edge synthetic affinity
ligand technology to reversibly inhibit the activity of Taq DNA Polymerase
based on temperature. Unlike standard hot-start enzymes, which block
polymerase activity only prior to the initial temperature rise, HM-Taq DNA
Polymerase utilizes an inhibitory ligand to obstruct the substrate-binding
site through temperature regulation. Below 40°C, the enzyme and inhibitor form
an inactive complex. However, as the temperature escalates to annealing
levels, the equilibrium shifts in favor of the template-primer complex. This
mechanism minimizes the creation of non-specific amplification products
throughout PCR, enhancing the accuracy of the reaction considerably. In
conclusion, for those grappling with non-specific amplification, hot-start
enzymes present an efficient solution. By understanding the nuances and
benefits of each type, researchers can better tailor their PCR processes for
optimal results. Bst Polymerase: Mastering Constant Temperature Amplification
In the ever-evolving field of molecular biology, the ability to amplify DNA at
constant temperatures presents both a challenge and an opportunity. The Bst
Polymerase family stands at the forefront of this niche, offering unique
enzymatic solutions tailored for a range of applications. Rooted in rigorous
research and enhanced through biotechnological advancements, our suite of Bst
Polymerases is meticulously designed to address diverse amplification needs.
Before delving into the specifics of each variant, let’s take a moment to
understand their foundational strengths and distinctions. We offer five
distinct variants of Bst Polymerase: Bst DNA Polymerase Large Fragment , Bst
DNA Polymerase , Bst Polymerase , Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase , and Bst P DNA/RNA
Polymerase . 1\. Bst DNA Polymerase Large Fragment : This is a recombinant
enzyme, meticulously purified from Escherichia coli expression. The gene for
this polymerase traces back to Bacillus stearothermophilus but has been
refined through selective point mutations to enhance its functionality. It
showcases a 5'→3' DNA polymerase activity and, notably, lacks both 5'→3' and
3'→5' exonuclease functions. This version also stands out for its exceptional
strand displacement capability. 2\. Bst DNA Polymerase (alternative of 2.0) :
Originating from Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA polymerase I, this enzyme
retains its 5'→3' polymerase activity due to genetic engineering that
eliminated its 5'→3' exonuclease function. This modification, coupled with its
pronounced strand-displacement ability, makes it a top choice for isothermal
amplification. When benchmarked against the wild-type Bst DNA polymerase
(large fragment), it exhibits marked advancements in amplification speed,
yield, salt resistance, and thermal stability. 3\. Bst Polymerase (alternative
of 3.0) : Another derivative of Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA polymerase I,
this version is distinct for having both 5'→3' and 3'→5' exonuclease functions
removed while maintaining its 5'→3' polymerase activity. Its strengths lie in
its superior isothermal amplification and potent reverse transcription
capabilities. Notably, it can undertake a single enzyme system reaction in
isothermal amplification experiments using RNA as a template. Operating
optimally between 60-65°C, it excels in transcribing RNA templates with
intricate secondary structures—a feat that its counterparts, Bst DNA
Polymerase and the wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large fragment), cannot
match. 4\. Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase : This is a harmonized blend of Bst
Polymerase and an ultra-thermostable reverse transcriptase, able to withstand
temperatures up to 65°C. Tailored for isothermal amplification reactions
involving RNA, it shines in detecting low-sensitivity RNA molecules. This
makes it the go-to choice for experiments where RNA serves as the template.
Moreover, it’s adept at isothermal amplification of DNA templates as well. 5\.
Bst P DNA/RNA Polymerase : Representing the pinnacle of our offerings, this
variant is a sophisticated iteration of Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase. Developed
through advanced enzyme electronic restructuring and evolution screening (both
in silico design & in vitro evolution), it's predominantly used for LAMP or
RT-LAMP amplifications. Enhancements include: Integration of a hot start
Aptamer ensuring over 95% enzyme activity blockage at temperatures below 30°C,
while releasing full activity within a minute at temperatures above 60°C. This
feature paves the way for setting up the reaction at ambient temperatures and
significantly diminishes non-specific amplifications at lower temperatures. A
heightened reaction temperature up to 70°C, which substantially curbs the
creation of primer dimers, sharpens amplification specificity, and ensures
more comprehensive nucleic acid release from crude samples. Inclusion of
Helicase, enabling Premium LAMP amplification (pLAMP) without the need for
F3/B3 primers. Additionally, Helicase assists in strand unwinding,
subsequently reducing the requisite concentration of FIP/BIP primers, which in
turn minimizes non-specific amplification and notably enhances amplification
uniformity. This comprehensive suite of Bst Polymerases ensures that
researchers and professionals have the right tool for every unique
amplification requirement. High Fidelity Enzymes: The Key to Rapid and Precise
Amplification In molecular experiments where precision is paramount, the
choice of enzymes plays a pivotal role. DNA polymerases like Pfu DNA
Polymerase and KODP DNA Polymerase are the go-to options for those seeking
high fidelity amplification. For projects that demand both unmatched accuracy
and exceptional speed, sPfu DNA Polymerase stands out. Its fidelity is an
impressive 64 times greater than that of Taq DNA Polymerase and 8 times that
of standard Pfu DNA Polymerase. Moreover, with an amplification rate of 10-30
sec/kb, its speed is commendable. Enter the SuperGold™ 1×sPfu MasterMix , an
all-in-one amplification reagent designed for ease and efficacy. Comprising
SuperGold™ sPfu DNA Polymerase (sPfu), dNTPs, dyes, and essential buffers, it
streamlines the PCR process. Users need only introduce their chosen primers
and DNA templates. This adaptability allows the addition of 1 to 10μl of
primers and templates, optimizing the PCR process. By integrating all
necessary components into one mix, it minimizes potential contamination risks
and shaves time off the experimental procedure. An added advantage? The
inclusion of dyes means that post-amplification, samples are electrophoresis-
ready, eliminating an extra step. The resulting amplified products have a
neat, blunt end. The SuperGold™ sPfu DNA Polymerase further accentuates the
promise of precision with a fidelity rate that's a staggering 69 times higher
than Taq DNA polymerase. Such exactness opens the door to cloning extensive
sequences. Simple templates like plasmids and lambda DNA see effective
amplification lengths up to 40 kb with the SuperGold™ High Fidelity PCR
MasterMix. In the case of genomes, the length extends to 20 kb, and for more
intricate fragments like cDNA, up to 10 kb. Speed is yet another feather in
its cap; the SuperGold™ High Fidelity DNA polymerase boasts an extension rate
of 15 sec/kb, quadrupling the pace of Taq DNA polymerase. From high-fidelity
PCR amplification and colony PCR to blunt-end PCR product amplification and
RT-PCR, this product is a versatile tool for a broad spectrum of molecular
applications. Conclusion: Picking the Right Tool for the Task In the realms of
molecular biology and genetic experimentation, selecting the appropriate DNA
polymerase is akin to picking the right tool for a particular task. As
discussed in this review, there's a plethora of DNA polymerases to choose
from, each with its unique advantages, nuances, and applications. For
beginners or those just venturing into PCR methodologies, the multitude of
options might appear daunting. But with an understanding of the basics and the
specific features of each type of polymerase, this vast landscape transforms
from a confusing array into a toolbox filled with specialized tools for
specific tasks. For instance, when prioritizing the amplification of DNA at a
constant temperature, the Bst polymerase family clearly stands out. If high
fidelity coupled with speedy amplification is the need, then the SuperGold™
sPfu DNA polymerase and its derivatives offer unparalleled precision and
efficiency. Similarly, for those struggling with non-specific amplification in
experiments, the nuances of hot start enzymes, be it antibody-modified or
synthetic-affinity-based, can vastly improve result accuracy. The evolution of
DNA polymerases mirrors the progress in molecular biology itself. With each
innovation, with every newly introduced enzyme variant, researchers gain
better tools leading to more accurate, efficient, and reliable experiments. As
the world of scientific research evolves, so too will the tools available for
its exploration. For the dedicated researcher or the curious scientist, our

the Potential of 37°C as an Optimal Reaction Temperature for Molecular
Detection From RPA to RCA, SDA to HDA: Unleashing the Diversity of Isothermal
Amplification Methods with a Common Optimal Temperature of 37°C for Molecular
Detection Innovations April 16, 2023 · Isothermal Amp Compared to the
temperature cycling PCR, isothermal amplification techniques are more diverse,
with the diversity of enzymes used determining the variations in the
principles of isothermal amplification. Although these methods are
collectively referred to as isothermal amplification techniques, the optimal
reaction temperature for each method varies. However, several isothermal
amplification techniques that we will introduce today share a common
characteristic, which is that their initial optimal reaction temperature is
around 37°C. Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) Introduction
Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) is a nucleic acid amplification
technique that is based on the DNA replication mechanism of T4 bacteriophage.
It uses the action of recombinase protein ( T4 UvsX Recombinase ), single-
stranded DNA-binding protein ( T4 Gene 32 Protein ), and DNA polymerase ( Bsu
DNA Polymerase ) to achieve isothermal amplification of nucleic acids in
vitro. The principle of RPA is as follows: In the presence of ATP, recombinase
T4 UvsX binds to the upstream and downstream primers to form a recombinase-
primer complex. This complex scans the double-stranded DNA template and
recognizes the target sequence homologous to the primers. After positioning to
the homologous target sequence, the recombinase opens the double-stranded
structure and promotes strand exchange between the primers and the template,
forming a D-loop structure. At the same time, single-stranded DNA-binding
protein T4 gp32 binds to the displaced single-stranded DNA, stabilizing the
D-loop structure. ATP hydrolysis provides energy, causing conformational
changes in the recombinase-primer complex, leading to exposure of the 3' end
of the primer, and DNA polymerase Bsu binds to the primer, initiating DNA
amplification. During DNA polymerase extension, the displaced single-stranded
DNA binds to the single-stranded DNA-binding protein, stabilizing the single-
stranded structure. The upstream and downstream primers react synchronously,
eventually resulting in the formation of a complete amplicon. The RPA system
also contains auxiliary factors ( T4 UvsY Protein ) and crowding agents
(Carbowax20M), which can regulate the reversible reaction process of
dissociation and reassembly of the recombinase-primer complex, favoring the
direction of RPA. If reverse transcriptase is added to the RPA system, it can
also be used for RNA detection. The incorporation of fluorescent probes and
nucleases into the RPA system allows for real-time detection and
visualization. Different types of fluorescent probes, along with their
corresponding nucleases, are designed differently, resulting in three types of
RPA probes: Exo probes, Fpg probes, and LF probes, each with their own
detection principles as follows: Exo probes: Exo probes, when combined with
exonucleases (exo), can be used for real-time detection. These probes
introduce a modification site of tetrahydrofuran abasic-site mimic (THF)
internally, which is coupled with fluorescent and quenching groups on either
side of the modification site. When the probe hybridizes with the target
sequence to form double-stranded DNA, exo recognizes the THF modification site
and cleaves at that position, separating the fluorescent and quenching groups,
resulting in a fluorescent signal. Fpg probes: Fpg probes, when combined with
Fpg nuclease, can also be used for real-time detection. These probes have a
quenching group modified at the 5' end, and a fluorescent group connected to
the probe base in the vicinity of the quenching group as C-O-C(dR group). When
the probe hybridizes with the target sequence to form double-stranded DNA, Fpg
nuclease recognizes the dR group and cleaves at that position, releasing the
fluorescent group and generating a fluorescent signal. LF probes: LF probes,
when combined with endonucleases (such as nfo) and lateral flow
chromatography, can achieve visual detection of RPA results. These probes are
modified with a fluorescent group at the 5' end, and also introduce a
tetrahydrofuran (THF) modification site internally. When the probe hybridizes
with the target sequence to form double-stranded DNA, nfo recognizes the THF
de-modification site and cleaves at that position, generating a free 3'-OH
group that can serve as a primer for further extension and amplification.
Simultaneously, the downstream primer modified with biotin is also amplified,
resulting in amplicons with fluorescent and biotin labels at both ends. These
amplicons, when combined with lateral flow chromatography, can be visually
observed for detection results. The 3' ends of these three types of probes
need to be blocked to prevent probe extension. If probes with different
fluorescent labels are used, it is possible to achieve multiplex detection.
Technical Features RPA is a multi-enzyme reaction system that requires the
cooperative action of multiple enzymes to achieve amplification. Different
manufacturers have established their own amplification technologies based on
different sources of key enzymes. RPA can be performed at a wide temperature
range of 25~42 °C without the need for thermal cycling, with the optimal
reaction temperature being around 37 °C . This temperature range overlaps with
the reaction temperature range of the CRISPR/Cas system, which has also
facilitated the development of next-generation molecular diagnostic
technologies. RPA has a fast reaction speed, with detection levels achieved
within 5~30 minutes, making it suitable for point-of-care testing (POCT)
applications. The primer length of RPA is typically 3035bp, and the length of
the fluorescent probe is 4652bp. Compared to other nucleic acid detection
technologies, both the primer and probe of RPA are relatively long, requiring
more optimization and screening during testing. At the same time, the longer
primer length also limits the ability of RPA to detect short nucleic acid
sequences. Further Reading: BodyIAmp™ Technology BodyIAmp™ technology is a
very unique technology of SBS Genetech, which is very similar to RPA
technology in principle. The difference is that the enzymes used come from
different species and are engineered to make the reaction faster. BodyIAmp™
technology is developed by advanced molecular design, directed evolution,
affinity maturation, and other technical means in the field of antibody
medicine to modify and mutate specific tool enzymes derived from bacteria,
viruses, and bacteriophages and screen their functions, obtaining a new rapid
isothermal amplification reaction system of nucleic acid through combinatorial
optimization. Under constant temperature conditions, it only takes 7-10
minutes to complete the specific amplification of target DNA fragments
hundreds of millions of times. Compared with similar technology products, its
low-temperature adaptability and sensitivity have made a new breakthrough,
reaching the world's industry-leading level. Rolling Circle Amplification
(RCA) Introduction Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) is a nucleic acid
detection method that mimics the natural process of circular DNA rolling
circle replication. The DNA polymerase used in RCA is phi29 DNA polymerase ,
which has strong strand displacement activity. RCA can be performed in linear
amplification mode or exponential amplification mode, as illustrated as
follows: For circular templates, a single primer complementary to the template
is added, and after primer-template hybridization, rolling circle
amplification is initiated, resulting in the synthesis of repetitive linear
single-stranded DNA sequences, which is a linear amplification process. For
linear target sequences, padlock probes can be designed with ends
complementary to the target sequence, and under the action of a ligase, the
padlock probes are ligated into a circular form, which can then serve as
templates for rolling circle amplification. In addition to the linear
amplification triggered by a single primer, a reverse primer sequence can be
added, which hybridizes with the single-stranded DNA amplification product,
and under the action of DNA polymerase, multiple branching amplification
reactions can occur due to the strand displacement activity of phi29 DNA
polymerase, resulting in exponential amplification of the product. Technical
Features RCA requires single-stranded circular templates for detection. If the
sample does not meet this requirement, denaturation and annealing treatment
may be needed for circularization. The linear amplification product of RCA is
a large amount of repetitive linear single-stranded DNA that is complementary
to the circular template. This allows for direct probe binding for signal
amplification, and the continuous amplification products can avoid signal
diffusion, making it suitable for in situ hybridization detection. The
efficiency of linear RCA can reach up to 10^5-fold, and the efficiency of
exponential RCA can reach up to 10^9-fold, allowing for single-molecule
detection. For RNA detection, there is no need for reverse transcription of
RNA prior to RCA. Only ensuring the recognition sequence of the probe is
complementary to the target sequence is sufficient for RCA detection. Based on
the principle of complementary pairing between the 5' and 3' recognition
sequences of padlock probes, this method can be used for SNP detection.
Further Reading: phi29 HT DNA Polymerase phi29 HT DNA polymerase is specially
engineered enzyme of SBS Genetech, which is an updated version of phi29 DNA
polymerase. In addition to the strong strand displacement and continuous
synthesis (> 70kb) activity of phi29 DNA polymerase, phi29 HT DNA polymerase
can continuously synthesize DNA at 42°C, while the activity of phi29 DNA
polymerase is very low at this temperature. In addition, phi29 HT DNA
Polymerase still has a strong 3 '- 5' exonuclease proofreading function and
the fidelity of the synthesized DNA fragments is high. The exonuclease
activity of this enzyme is strong, so the primer needs 3'- end thio-
modification in the process of synthesis to reduce the cleavage effect of the
exonuclease activity on the primer. The high-temperature reaction
characteristic of phi29 HT DNA Polymerase has the following advantages: In the
next generation sequencing (NGS), the enzyme has stronger amplification
activity for complex templates such as high GC content and palindrome
structure, which makes the coverage of NGS more uniform and reduces the depth
required for sequencing. High-temperature reaction conditions improve the
synthesis of WGA products of genomic DNA and can be used for variable
temperature amplification. The gap region in sequencing is reduced, which can
improve the quality and integrity of the data from single-cell sequencing.
Reduce non-specific amplification products. Improve the amplification
performance and specificity of MDA/RCA and other experiments. Strand
Displacement Amplification (SDA) Introduction Strand Displacement
Amplification (SDA) is a temperature-dependent amplification technique that
relies on the cleavage of DNA restriction enzyme recognition sites (such as
HincII) by restriction endonucleases, and the extension of the cleavage site
by DNA polymerases (such as exo-Klenow), followed by displacement of
downstream DNA fragments. The original principle of first-generation SDA is as
follows: In the first-generation SDA, amplification is performed using a pair
of primers containing the recognition sequence of the restriction enzyme (such
as HincII recognition site 5'-GTT//GAC-3'). Prior to amplification, the
template is first cleaved by the restriction enzyme, and then annealed to the
primers through heat denaturation. In the presence of a DNA polymerase with no
exonuclease activity (such as exo-Klenow), extension occurs to form double-
stranded DNA, generating a cleavage site recognized by the restriction enzyme.
However, due to the addition of a chemically modified dNTP (such as dATPαS) in
the reaction system, HincII will only cleave the unmodified DNA strand at the
cleavage site (such as 5'-GTT//GAC-3' or 5'-GTT//GsAC-3'), while the other
strand containing a phosphorothioate modification will not be cleaved,
resulting in the formation of a nick with a exposed 3' end. This nick serves
as a primer for DNA polymerase extension to initiate amplification, resulting
in the formation of amplification products with cleavage sites in a partially
modified state. In addition, during the extension process of DNA polymerase,
the downstream DNA single strand is displaced, and the displaced DNA single
strand can anneal to the primers to initiate further amplification, resulting
in the formation of double-stranded DNA with cleavage sites in a partially
modified state. The restriction endonuclease then recognizes and cleaves the
cleavage site again. This process of cleavage by the restriction enzyme, DNA
polymerase-mediated amplification, and strand displacement reaction cycles,
leading to a cyclic amplification process. The first-generation SDA requires
the use of a restriction endonuclease to cleave the target DNA, generating
templates that can be used for amplification. This not only increases the
difficulty of the procedure but also limits the choice of target sequences.
The second-generation SDA has improved upon this by simplifying the process
and using two pairs of primers instead of one. The outer primers (B1 and B2)
are conventional specific primers, while the inner primers (S1 and S2) are
similar to those used in the first-generation SDA, with a restriction
endonuclease recognition sequence at the 5' end. The reaction principle is as
follows: The target sequence is denatured by heat, and during the annealing
process, the inner primers (S1 and S2) and the outer primers (B1 and B2) bind
to the target sequence, initiating the amplification. The synthesis chain
initiated by the outer primers can displace the synthesis chain of the inner
primers. The single-stranded DNA continues to anneal and extend with the inner
primers, ultimately forming double-stranded DNA molecules with restriction
endonuclease recognition sites, which serve as the main templates for entering
the SDA amplification cycle. The restriction endonuclease recognizes and
cleaves the unmodified DNA strand at the restriction site, creating a nick.
DNA polymerase extends from the nick and displaces the downstream DNA strand.
The cycling process formed in this way is similar to the first-generation SDA.
Technical Features SDA requires a heat denaturation step to open the double-
stranded DNA before isothermal amplification. If the enzyme used is not
thermostable, stepwise addition may be required. SDA reaction system requires
the addition of chemically modified nucleotides to ensure that the restriction
endonuclease only forms a nick at the restriction site. The inclusion of non-
standard nucleotides may reduce the amplification efficiency. Similar to SDA,
another isothermal amplification technique called Nicking Enzyme Amplification
Reaction (NEAR) uses a nicking endonuclease as the restriction enzyme, which
cleaves only one strand of the double-stranded DNA to form a nick, allowing
amplification with regular nucleotides. The enzyme used in NEAR is
thermostable, and the reaction temperature can reach around 54°C. Helicase-
Dependent Amplification (HDA) Introduction Helicase-Dependent Amplification
(HDA) is an in vitro isothermal amplification technique that mimics the DNA
replication mechanism in animals. It uses components such as helicase and
single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) to replace the temperature cycling
process of denaturation-annealing-extension in PCR. The reaction principle is
as follows: Helicase unwinds the double-stranded DNA, and SSB binds to the
single-stranded DNA, stabilizing the single-stranded state. Primers bind to
the single-stranded target sequence, and new double-stranded DNA is
synthesized by DNA polymerase. The newly synthesized double-stranded DNA can
serve as a template for the next round of amplification by repeating the above
steps. Technical Features Compared to other isothermal amplification
techniques, the amplification process of HDA is simple, akin to a
thermocycling version of PCR. The amplification process requires the
coordinated action of helicase and polymerase, with a need to balance their
reaction rates to favor synthesis of new strands. The initial reaction
temperature of HDA is 37 °C , but through screening, adjustment of key
components, and genetic engineering modifications, a thermostable HDA has been
developed, with a reaction temperature of around 65 °C . Summary and Prospect
37 °C , the temperature within human touch, is the basis for molecular
detection methods that are most imaginative in future applications. Just
imagine, a molecular detection product that can provide results simply by
warming it up with your hand... Of course, an ideal molecular detection
product cannot be achieved solely by optimizing nucleic acid amplification
methods. Considerations need to be given to sample pre-processing, result
presentation, convenience and safety of product use before and after, and
more. Moreover, the requirement for reaction equipment is low when it comes to
a reaction temperature around 37 °C , at least from the perspective of energy
consumption. With the product performance reaching its peak, it may not even
need a device powered by batteries. Just imagine, in the future, you can
perform molecular detection anywhere, anytime with a simple gesture, without
worrying about energy supply, how convenient and high-tech that would be! In
fact, looking back at the development history of some amplification
technologies, the past trend was to establish an in vitro nucleic acid
amplification method under moderate to low temperature conditions, and then
further improve the application value of the technology by seeking heat-stable
components to optimize the reaction system. However, with the continuous
advancement of technology and the expansion of application scenarios, will the
iteration strategy of technology change in the future? Will the constant
temperature for reactions approach the human body temperature of 37 °C ? This
is an exciting question to anticipate. Just imagine, in the future, we could
perform molecular detection at a comfortable temperature without the need for
additional heating devices, creating a perfect fusion of technology and the
human body experience. At the current stage, the temperature of 37 °C leaves
us with boundless imagination, and we look forward to more surprises and
breakthroughs in the future of technological development. Let us continue to
explore and expand the boundaries of molecular detection technology, creating
a more astonishing future. Subscribe Previous Choosing Your Best Phi29 DNA

particularly with the advancement of Real-time Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
technology, nucleic acid amplification techniques have permeated various
fields of biological science. Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) ,
developed by the UK-based company TwistDx Inc in 2006, has emerged as a
rapidly evolving isothermal amplification technology in recent years. It
offers advantages such as rapidity, sensitivity, good specificity, and
suitability for on-site rapid detection, and has been applied in multiple
fields including transgenic organisms, various pathogens, and food safety
testing. In the field of transgenic organisms, RPA technology enables
researchers to quickly and accurately detect and identify transgenic
sequences, providing effective technical support for related research. In
pathogen detection, the high specificity and sensitivity of RPA technology
make it an ideal choice for rapid pathogen detection, particularly playing a
significant role in clinical diagnosis and epidemic monitoring. Additionally,
RPA technology is widely utilized in the field of food safety, where it can be
employed for the rapid detection of potential contaminants or pathogenic
microorganisms in food, ensuring food safety and public health. Basics of RPA
The RPA reaction primarily relies on the recombinase UvsX and the recombinase
loading factor UvsY (auxiliary protein) derived from the T4 bacteriophage,
along with the Single-Stranded DNA-Binding Protein (SSB) Gp32, and the strand-
displacing DNA polymerase Bsu (Bacillus subtilis Pol) or Sau (Staphylococcus
aureus Pol). The amplification of the template is achieved based on the T4
bacteriophage's nucleic acid replication mechanism. Initially, in the presence
of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the primer forms a nucleoprotein filament
complex with the recombinase UvsX. This complex bi-directionally scans the
target double-stranded DNA for homologous sequences. Once a homologous
sequence is found, the recombinase dissociates the double-stranded DNA at this
position, forming a D-loop structure. One side of the D-loop remains double-
stranded, undergoing strand displacement, while the other side becomes single-
stranded, stabilized by the SSB protein Gp32. Subsequently, the nucleoprotein
filament complex actively hydrolyzes ATP, causing a conformational change and
exposing the 3' end of the primer. At this point, the DNA polymerase Bsu binds
to the 3' end of the primer, initiating the DNA amplification reaction and
forming a new complementary strand. In this reaction, the processes mediated
by forward and reverse primers occur simultaneously. The newly formed single
strand pairs with the original strand, generating a complete amplicon. This
amplification process repeats continuously, leading to exponential growth of
the amplification product. The entire process is typically completed within 20
minutes. During the reaction, competition exists between the SSB protein and
UvsX for primer binding sites. The auxiliary protein UvsY can invade the
primer-covered binding sites of the SSB protein, preventing the recombination
phenomenon that occurs when the SSB protein binds to the primer, and it can
facilitate the binding of UvsX to the primer, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Schematic Diagram of Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA)
Types of RPA Detection Methods Basic RPA Detection Basic RPA detection is a
nucleic acid detection method that combines RPA technology with agarose gel
electrophoresis. The main detection process involves performing RPA
amplification reaction under constant temperature conditions (37-39°C) for
20-40 minutes. After the reaction is completed, agarose gel electrophoresis is
used to detect the RPA amplification products. Components such as recombinase
and single-stranded binding protein in the RPA reaction system can bind to the
amplification products, inhibiting their migration in the gel. This can lead
to smear patterns in gel electrophoresis results. To avoid this, phenol and
chloroform are added to the amplification products in a 1:1 volume ratio. The
products are then extracted, and the extracted amplification products are
subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. Similar to the gel electrophoresis
process for PCR products, RPA amplification products are mixed with nucleic
acid dyes like EB before gel electrophoresis. The presence or absence of bands
and their sizes on the gel determine the detection results of the target
nucleic acid. Recombinase Polymerase Amplification with Lateral Flow Dipstick
(RPA-LFD) RPA-LFD is a nucleic acid detection method that combines RPA
technology with lateral flow dipstick (LFD). In comparison to the basic RPA
detection method, the RPA-LFD reaction system includes a DNA endonuclease
(nfo), an nfo probe, and a downstream primer labeled with biotin. The nfo
probe is approximately 50 nt long, with a FAM fluorescent group at the 5' end,
a blocking group (typically C3spacer) at the 3' end, and a tetrahydrofuran
(THF) molecule in the middle, as shown in Figure 2. The DNA endonuclease nfo
recognizes the THF molecule in the nfo probe and cleaves it. After cleavage,
the probe produces a free hydroxyl end, acting as an upstream primer. This new
upstream primer, along with the biotin-labeled downstream primer, undergoes
amplification to yield an amplification product with a FAM group at the 5' end
and biotin at the 3' end. This amplification product can be detected using a
lateral flow dipstick. Figure 2: Schematic Diagram of the Structure of the nfo
Probe LFD, based on lateral flow chromatography, immunology, and colloidal
gold technologies, is a type of test strip. The strip is mainly composed of
three parts: the sample pad, detection line, and control line. The sample pad
contains colloidal gold particles labeled with anti-FAM antibodies, the
detection line has a ligand with biotin, and the control line has another
antibody that can bind to anti-FAM antibodies. The specific detection
principle of LFD is illustrated in Figure 3. Firstly, the FAM groups on the
amplification product bind to the anti-FAM antibodies on the sample pad,
forming an immune complex. Then, all colloidal gold particles migrate to the
detection line under the action of the buffer solution. When they reach the
detection line, the biotin on the amplification product is captured by the
biotin ligand on the detection line, causing the amplification product to
aggregate. This aggregation results in the appearance of a red band on the
detection line. Colloidal gold particles that fail to bind to the
amplification product continue to migrate beyond the detection line. When they
reach the control line, the anti-FAM antibodies on the colloidal gold
particles bind to the antibodies on the control line, leading to the
aggregation of colloidal gold particles and the appearance of a red band on
the control line. The presence of a red band on the control line indicates the
completion of LFD detection. Therefore, when the test result is positive, two
red bands can be observed on the LFD – one on the detection line and one on
the control line. When the result is negative, only a red band on the control
line is visible on the LFD. Currently, LFD can be combined with various
nucleic acid amplification technologies such as LAMP, RCA, and RPA for the
detection of target nucleic acids. The advantage of RPA-LFD lies in its simple
operation, absence of complex instruments, and the ability to directly observe
the detection results with the naked eye, making it suitable for on-site rapid
testing. Figure 3: Schematic Diagram of LFD Detection Principle Real-time
Fluorescent RPA Detection The real-time fluorescent RPA detection method is a
nucleic acid detection approach that combines RPA technology with real-time
fluorescent detection technology. In comparison to the basic RPA detection
method's reaction system, the real-time fluorescent RPA reaction system
incorporates the nucleic acid endonuclease exo and exo probes. The exo probe
is a probe with a size of 46-52 nt, featuring a pair of thymine bases, each
carrying a fluorescent group and a quenching group. These thymine bases are
separated by a THF spacer, and the 3' end of the probe is connected to a
blocking group. The specific structure of the probe is illustrated in Figure
4. The fluorescent group in the probe is generally FAM, the quenching group is
typically BHQ, and the blocking group is commonly C3spacer. The nucleic acid
endonuclease exo can recognize THF molecules in the exo probe and, after
hybridization of the exo probe with the amplification product, cleave the THF
molecule. This cleavage separates the fluorescent and quenching groups in the
probe, leading to the generation of fluorescence. Equipment capable of real-
time monitoring of fluorescent signals can be used to detect the fluorescence
intensity during the reaction process, allowing for the determination of the
detection results for the target nucleic acid. Figure 4: Schematic Diagram of
the Structure of the exo Probe Currently, real-time fluorescent RPA detection
methods have found widespread application in pathogen detection, food safety,
and other fields. In comparison to basic RPA detection methods and RPA-LFD
methods, the real-time fluorescent RPA detection method offers notable
advantages with a shorter detection time, completing within 20 minutes.
Additionally, it exhibits high specificity and sensitivity. Figure 5:
Simplified Diagram of LFD-RPA Applications of RPA Since its inception, the RPA
technology has been applied in various fields such as single-gene mutation
detection, water sources, food safety, infectious disease detection, as well
as the detection of common pathogens in agriculture and animal husbandry. 1\.
Bacterial Detection Traditional bacterial cultivation is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and susceptible to contamination. RPA technology has shown
significant advantages in bacterial detection. For instance, E. coli, a normal
flora in the human intestinal tract, can cause severe enteritis and diarrhea
when consumed through contaminated food. Liu Jingwen and others utilized RT-
RPA with exo probes at 37°C to qualitatively detect E. coli within 20 minutes,
achieving a significantly shorter detection time compared to traditional
methods. The method also demonstrated a low detection limit of 0.01ng/μl,
providing technical support for rapid clinical diagnosis. Wang et al.
developed a dual-detection biosensor based on RPA and a three-stage lateral
flow strip. The biosensor performed dual-chain RPA reactions for Vibrio
cholerae and Vibrio vulnificus. This method boasts high sensitivity,
specificity, short reaction time, and simplicity, making it suitable for
grassroots hospitals and real-time on-site detection. 2\. Virus Detection RPA
technology is applicable for the immediate detection of various viruses
without cross-contamination. Yehia combined RPA technology with reverse
transcription to establish a detection method for the H5N1 virus,
demonstrating high sensitivity capable of detecting 1 copy of viral RNA.
Behrman integrated RPA technology with real-time fluorescence detection for a
rapid detection method of novel coronaviruses, achieving results within 15-20
minutes for 7 copies of viral RNA. RPA technology is also applicable to the
detection of Monkeypox virus, Newcastle disease virus, Spring viremia of carp
virus, African swine fever virus, Canine parvovirus, and others. 3\. Parasite
Detection In the realm of parasite detection, RPA methods have been
established for protozoa, nematodes, trematodes, and other parasites. Kersting
et al. targeted the amplification of the 18S rRNA gene fragment of the malaria
parasite using RPA-LFD, demonstrating high specificity and sensitivity under
mild reaction conditions. This method is suitable for on-site inspections in
remote areas, contributing to global progress in malaria prevention and
control. Guo Qinghong developed an RPA-LFD detection method for diagnosing
Japanese schistosomiasis in mice and sheep using the G01 fragment. The method
exhibited high sensitivity (97.22% for mice, 93.75% for sheep) and 100%
specificity for negative samples, showing no cross-reactivity with other
flukes. The results indicate that the RPA-LFD method has high specificity and
sensitivity for detecting Japanese schistosomiasis. 4\. Food Safety Detection
RPA technology is widely applied in food safety detection. Choi established a
detection method for Vibrio parahaemolyticus using RPA, achieving detection
within 20 minutes. Tang developed a real-time fluorescent RPA detection method
for Vibrio cholerae, capable of detecting 5 copies of bacterial DNA within 20
minutes. Additionally, RPA technology is utilized for the screening and
detection of genetically modified crops, with Chandu developing real-time
fluorescent RPA and RPA-LFD detection methods for genetically modified
soybeans. Advances of RPA The evolution of RPA systems exemplifies a

MPQU-100 (for 100T) Cat. No.: MPQU-500 (for 500T) Cat. No.: MPQU-2500 (for

anti-contamination (Carryover prevention) premix for multiplex real-time
fluorescent quantitative PCR based on probes such as TaqMan. It is mainly used
for ultra-sensitive specific quantitative detection of cDNA and genomic DNA.
This product contains an optimized proportion of high-quality UDG enzyme and
dUTP, which effectively eliminates the false positives or low CT values caused
by product contamination during PCR amplification. Since TaqMan probes are
generally used, this method is also commonly referred to as the anti-
contamination multiplex TaqMan probe method. UDG (Uracil-DNA Glycosylase),
also known as UNG (Uracil-N-glycosylase), can catalyze the hydrolysis of the
N-glycosidic bond between the uracil (dU) base in the DNA strand containing
uracil and deoxyribose, thereby releasing free uracil. It is mainly used to
eliminate product contamination problems caused by PCR amplification. Its
contamination prevention principle is: by adding an appropriate amount of dUTP
in the PCR reaction, replacing dTTP with dUTP in DNA, forming PCR
amplification products containing dU bases. In subsequent PCR reactions, the
UDG enzyme selectively cuts the single or double-stranded DNA containing dU
that may have been contaminated from previous PCR amplifications, thus
avoiding the potential contamination of previous PCR products on the current
PCR amplification. This product is particularly suitable for the quantitative
or qualitative detection of low abundance or high specificity target genes.
For example, highly sensitive detection of low abundance mRNA, lncRNA, small
RNA, microbial RNA after reverse transcription, and SNP detection of
homologous genes or genes with high similarity that are difficult to
distinguish using conventional dye methods. Principle The probe method qPCR
does not use fluorescent dyes such as SYBR Green to stain PCR products.
Instead, it employs a DNA probe labeled with a fluorescent group and a
quenching group (quencher) targeting the target sequence to be detected by PCR
(the probe binding site is usually located between the two primer binding
sites). Normally, the quencher on the probe causes fluorescence quenching due
to spatial fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). During the PCR
reaction amplification of the target sequence, both primers and probes will
anneal to the target gene. With the extension of the primer, the 5'→3'
exonuclease activity of the Taq enzyme causes the probe bound to the target
sequence to be degraded from the 5' end. After the fluorescent group and
quenching group of the probe are cut by the Taq enzyme, the action of the
quenching group disappears, and the fluorescent group can be excited by the
excitation light to produce fluorescence. With each PCR cycle, more
fluorescent groups are released, and the fluorescence intensity is directly
proportional to the number of newly synthesized target fragments, allowing for
quantitative detection. The probe is usually a linear DNA specific to the
target sequence, with a fluorescent group like FAM or HEX at the 5' end, and a
fluorescence quenching group like BHQ1, TAMRA, or MGB at the 3' end. Features
Good specificity, high sensitivity, and broad compatibility: Specificity
depends not only on PCR primers but also on the specificity of the probe.
Specific binding and degradation of the probe and target gene can produce a
fluorescent signal, and the sensitivity and specificity of detection are
usually significantly higher than methods using fluorescent dyes like SYBR
Green. For multiplex detection : In a single reaction well, different genes
correspond to different probes, and different probes correspond to different
fluorescent labels, enabling multiplex fluorescent quantitative PCR detection.
Tests have shown that, with proper optimization of primers and probes, this
product can be used for the detection of 2-4 genes simultaneously. The product
is compatible with a wide range of product GC content and primer Tm values.
Hotstart property : The Hotstart Taq DNA Polymerase used in this product is a
high-quality heat-activated enzyme bound to an antibody. It achieves
convenient and efficient heat activation. The Taq enzyme in Hotstart Taq DNA
Polymerase binds to the monoclonal antibody against Taq enzyme, inhibiting the
DNA polymerase activity of the Taq enzyme. This effectively prevents non-
specific annealing of primers and template DNA or dimerization of primers at
low temperatures. The antibody is inactivated by heating during the pre-
denaturation step of the PCR reaction, ensuring that the activity of the Taq
enzyme is only released after pre-denaturation. There is no DNA polymerization
reaction before denaturation, greatly improving the specificity, sensitivity,
and accuracy of PCR reactions and quantitative detection. Easy to use : This
product includes all common components such as Hotstart Taq DNA Polymerase,
UDG enzyme, PCR Buffer, dNTPs, dUTP, stabilizers, and magnesium ions, making
operation simpler and more convenient. Users only need to prepare primers,
probes, sample DNA, and deionized water. ROX Dye This product offers both Low
ROX and High ROX, making it broadly compatible with fluorescent quantitative
PCR machines that either do not require ROX or require Low ROX or High ROX as
a reference dye. The role of ROX is to correct fluorescence fluctuations
unrelated to PCR, thereby minimizing inter-well variations. Such variations
can be caused by various factors, such as pipetting errors and sample
evaporation. Different fluorescent quantitative PCR machines have different
requirements for ROX, so please choose either high concentration ROX (High
ROX), low concentration ROX (Low ROX), or no ROX Probe based on the specific
instrument in use when preparing the reaction system. Storage Store in the
dark at -20ºC, valid for one year; Store in the dark at 4ºC, valid for one
month. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Precautions The fluorescence
labeling of the probe should be determined based on the fluorescence
compatibility of the qPCR machine in use. For fluorescent quantitative PCR
machines that require ROX as a correction dye, avoid using ROX-labeled probes.
When used for multiplex detection, it is necessary to optimize primers and
probes properly, and use probes labeled with appropriate different fluorescent
groups. After confirming the results, proceed with multiplex detection. It is
generally recommended not to exceed four-fold detection. Before use, ensure
that the entire tube of reagent is completely thawed. Invert gently to mix
before using. Avoid introducing air bubbles during the mixing process. Pay
attention to the primer annealing temperature. When the annealing temperature
is <60ºC, a three-step PCR amplification is recommended. For amplification
fragments exceeding 350bp or with a high GC content, it is advised to extend
the elongation time to 60 seconds or adopt a three-step method to improve
amplification efficiency. Through testing, it has been observed that 10
repeated freeze-thaw cycles have no significant impact on the product's
effectiveness. However, repeated freeze-thaw cycles should still be avoided,
as they might reduce the product's performance. qPCR detection is ultra-
sensitive. Even though this product has excellent contamination prevention,
the PCR reaction setup area should still avoid any potential contamination
from amplifiable products. Dispose of PCR products in a sealed manner to
prevent contamination of the experimental environment by high-concentration
PCR products. This product is exclusively for scientific research by
professionals and should not be used for clinical diagnosis or treatment,
food, or drugs. It should not be stored in ordinary residences. For your

Description Probe One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (20X, UDG) is a new high-quality
carryover prevention kit for one-step reverse transcription real-time
quantitative PCR based on probes such as TaqMan. It's primarily used for the
ultra-sensitive quantitative detection of RNA. This product contains an
optimized ratio of high-quality UDG enzyme and dUTP, effectively eliminating
false positives or lowered CT values caused by product contamination during
PCR amplification. Since the commonly used probe is TaqMan, this method is
often referred to as the carryover prevention TaqMan probe method. UDG
(Uracil-DNA Glycosylase), also known as UNG (Uracil-N-glycosylase), catalyzes
the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond between the uracil (dU) base in the
DNA strand containing uracil and deoxyribose, releasing free uracil. It is
primarily used to eliminate product contamination issues during PCR
amplification. Its contamination prevention principle involves adding an
appropriate amount of dUTP in the PCR reaction to substitute dTTP into the
DNA, producing PCR amplification products with dU bases. In subsequent PCR
reactions, UDG enzyme selectively cleaves any single or double-stranded DNA
containing dU brought in by potential contamination from previous PCR
amplifications, preventing the contamination from negatively impacting the
current PCR amplification. The Probe One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (UDG) uses extracted
RNA as a template. It conducts reverse transcription and fluorescence
quantitative PCR consecutively in the same reaction tube. The process is
simple and quick, minimizes manual errors, effectively reduces contamination
risks, saves PCR operation time, and has a large detection throughput. This
product integrates the highly efficient M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase, RNase
Inhibitor, and the superior antibody-bound BeyoFast™ Taq DNA Polymerase. The
buffer system has been optimized for excellent reverse transcription
performance, high detection sensitivity, strong amplification specificity, and
stable reactions. It's particularly suitable for detecting low abundance
endogenous RNA, exogenous viral RNA, and other minute RNA samples. Principle
The probe-based qPCR does not use fluorescent dyes like SYBR Green to stain
PCR products. Instead, it uses a DNA probe labeled with a fluorescent group
and a quencher targeting the sequence intended for PCR detection (the designed
probe binding site is typically between the two primer binding sites).
Normally, the quencher on the probe causes fluorescence quenching of the
fluorescent group due to Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). During PCR
reaction, both the primer and probe anneal to the target gene. As the primer
extends, the 5'→3' exonuclease activity of Taq enzyme causes the probe bound
to the target sequence to degrade from the 5' end. After the Taq enzyme cuts
the probe's fluorescent group and quencher, the quencher's effect disappears,
allowing the fluorescent group to produce fluorescence when excited. Each PCR
cycle releases more fluorescent groups, with fluorescence intensity directly
proportional to the number of newly synthesized target fragments, enabling
quantitative detection. The probe is typically a linear DNA specific to the
target sequence, with its 5' end labeled with a fluorescent group like FAM or
HEX, and its 3' end labeled with a fluorescence quenching group like BHQ1,
TAMRA, or MGB. Features High specificity and sensitivity : Specificity isn't
solely reliant on PCR primers. Only when the probe specifically binds and
degrades with the target gene can a fluorescent signal be generated. Its
detection sensitivity and specificity are typically significantly higher than
methods using fluorescent dyes like SYBR Green. For multiplex detection : In a
single reaction well, different genes correspond to different probes, and
different probes correspond to different fluorescent labels, enabling
multiplex fluorescence quantitative PCR detection. Testing shows that, after
properly optimizing primers and probes, this product can be used
simultaneously to detect 2-3 genes. Hotstart property : The Hotstart Taq DNA
Polymerase used in this product is a high-quality heat-activated enzyme bound
with antibodies. It allows convenient and efficient heat activation. In
Hotstart Taq DNA Polymerase, the Taq enzyme binds with a monoclonal antibody
against Taq enzyme, inhibiting the enzyme's DNA polymerase activity,
effectively preventing non-specific annealing of primers and template DNA or
primer dimerization at low temperatures. The antibody is deactivated by
heating in the pre-denaturation step of the PCR reaction, ensuring the release
of Taq enzyme activity only after pre-denaturation, preventing DNA
polymerization before then, thereby significantly improving PCR reaction
specificity, sensitivity, and quantitative detection accuracy. Easy to use :
This product contains M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase, Hotstart Taq DNA
Polymerase, UDG enzyme, PCR Buffer, dNTPs, dUTP, stabilizers, Nuclease-free
Water, ROX (selected based on different fluorescence quantitative PCR
machines), magnesium ions, and all other universal components, making
operations simpler and use more convenient. Users only need to provide
primers, probes, and sample RNA. ROX Dye This product offers both Low ROX and
High ROX, making it broadly compatible with fluorescent quantitative PCR
machines that either don't require ROX or require Low ROX or High ROX as a
reference dye. The role of ROX is to correct fluorescence fluctuations
unrelated to the PCR process, thereby minimizing inter-well differences. These
variations can be caused by several factors, such as pipetting errors and
sample evaporation. Different fluorescent quantitative PCR machines have
different requirements for ROX. Depending on the specific equipment in use,
one should choose either a high concentration ROX (High ROX), low
concentration ROX (Low ROX), or no ROX Probe when setting up the reaction
system. Storage Store in the dark at -20ºC. Valid for two years. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Precautions The fluorescent labeling of the probe
must be determined based on the fluorescence compatibility of the qPCR
instrument being used. For fluorescent quantitative PCR machines that require
ROX as a reference dye, avoid probes labeled with ROX. When used for multiplex
detection, it's essential to appropriately optimize primers and probes and use
probes labeled with suitable distinct fluorescent groups. Before conducting
multiplex detection, confirm its effectiveness; it's generally recommended not
to exceed triple detection. If using for triple or quadruple detection, we
recommend Multiplex Probe qPCR Mix (2X, UDG) . Please avoid RNase
contamination and use RNase-free pipette tips, centrifuge tubes, etc. Probe
One-Step Enzyme Mix (20X, UDG) contains a high concentration of glycerol and
is viscous. Before use, briefly centrifuge to collect the contents at the
bottom of the tube, then gently mix with a pipettor. Try to avoid introducing
air bubbles during the mixing process and then pipette slowly and accurately.
Ensure that the Probe One-Step Reaction Buffer (2X) is fully thawed before
use. Invert and mix gently before application. If the amplification fragment
is long or the RNA structure is complex, pre-treat the template RNA at 65ºC
for 5-10 minutes to improve reverse transcription efficiency. For this
reaction, the qPCR's Reverse Primer serves as the gene-specific primer for
reverse transcription. Do not use Random Hexamer Primer or Oligo(dT) Primer,
which are typically used for cDNA first-strand synthesis. Take note of the
primer annealing temperature. When the annealing temperature is <60ºC, it's
recommended to use a three-step PCR amplification method. For amplicons
exceeding 350bp or with a high GC content, consider extending the elongation
time to 60 seconds or use the three-step method to improve amplification
efficiency. Tests show that repeated freeze-thawing up to 10 times doesn't
significantly impact the product's performance. Nevertheless, try to minimize
freeze-thawing, as this might degrade the product over time. qPCR detection is
ultra-sensitive. Even though this product has excellent anti-contamination
properties, the area where the PCR reaction is set up should still be kept
free from potential contamination. Dispose of PCR products securely to prevent
contamination of the experimental environment by high-concentration PCR
products. This product is intended for scientific research use by
professionals only. It must not be used for clinical diagnosis or treatment,
nor for food or drugs, and should not be stored in ordinary residences. For

amplification. The SYBR Green method is often referred to as the dye method,
hence this approach is commonly known as the carryover prevention dye method.

quality, carryover prevention premix reagent kit for one-step quantitative
reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR or real-time RT-PCR) based on SYBR Green
dye. It is primarily designed for ultra-sensitive and specific quantification
of RNA. This product contains an optimized ratio of high-quality UDG enzyme
and dUTP, effectively eliminating the risk of false positives or low CT values
caused by product contamination in PCR amplification. The SYBR Green method is
often referred to as the dye method, hence this approach is commonly known as
the carryover prevention dye method. UDG (Uracil-DNA Glycosylase), also known
as UNG (Uracil-N-glycosylase), catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic
bond between the uracil (dU) base in the DNA chain and deoxyribose, releasing
free uracil. It is mainly used to eliminate the product contamination issues
in PCR amplification. The principle of contamination prevention is to add an
appropriate amount of dUTP in the PCR reaction, replacing dTTP with dUTP in
DNA, forming PCR amplification products containing the dU base. In subsequent
PCR reactions, the UDG enzyme selectively cuts the single or double-stranded
DNA containing dU that might have been contaminated from previous PCR
amplification, preventing potential contamination effects on the current PCR
amplification. SYBR Green One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (UDG) uses extracted RNA as a
template and qPCR primers to continuously perform reverse transcription and
fluorescence quantitative PCR in the same reaction tube. This ensures quick,
simple operations, minimizing human errors, effectively reducing contamination
risk, saving operational time in PCR experiments, and enabling high
throughput. This product integrates efficient M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase,
RNase Inhibitor, and the superior antibody-bound hotstart Taq DNA Polymerase,
with an optimized buffer system. It offers excellent reverse transcription
performance, high sensitivity, strong amplification specificity, and good
reaction stability. It is particularly suitable for the detection of low-
abundance endogenous RNA, exogenous viral RNA, and other trace RNAs. SYBR
Green One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (20X, UDG) uses SYBR Green I as a dye. SYBR Green I
is a green fluorescent dye that binds to the minor groove region of double-
stranded DNA (dsDNA). Its fluorescence is relatively weak when unbound, but
greatly intensifies upon binding to dsDNA. Thus, by monitoring fluorescence
intensity, one can quantify the amount of dsDNA produced during PCR
amplification. The hotstart Taq DNA Polymerase used in this product is a high-
quality, antibody-bound hot start enzyme. The Taq enzyme in hotstart Taq DNA
Polymerase binds with a monoclonal antibody against the Taq enzyme, inhibiting
the Taq enzyme's DNA polymerase activity. This effectively prevents non-
specific annealing of primers and template DNA or primer dimer formation at
low temperatures. During the denaturation step of the PCR reaction, the
antibody is inactivated by heat, ensuring the Taq enzyme's activity is
released only after denaturation. There is no DNA polymerization before
denaturation, significantly improving PCR specificity, sensitivity, and
quantitative detection accuracy. This product includes M-MuLV Reverse
Transcriptase, hotstart Taq DNA Polymerase, UDG enzyme, PCR Buffer, dNTPs,
dUTP, SYBR Green I fluorescent dye, stabilizers, nuclease-free water, ROX
(selected based on different fluorescent quantitative PCR machines), and
magnesium ions, among other standard components. This makes operation simpler
and use more convenient. Users only need to prepare their primers and sample
RNA. ROX Dye The product offers both Low ROX and High ROX, widely compatible
with fluorescent quantitative PCR machines that either do not require ROX or
require either Low ROX or High ROX as a correction dye. ROX's role is to
correct fluorescence fluctuations unrelated to PCR, minimizing inter-well
differences. Such variations might be caused by pipetting errors or sample
evaporation. Different fluorescent quantitative PCR machines have varying
requirements for ROX; hence users should select high concentration ROX (High
ROX), low concentration ROX (Low ROX), or no ROX based on the actual
instrument being used. Storage Store at -20ºC in a dark place, valid for two
years. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Precautions Be careful to avoid
RNase contamination. Use RNase-free pipette tips and centrifuge tubes. The
SYBR Green One-Step Enzyme Mix (20X, UDG) contains high-concentration
glycerol, which has a high viscosity. Before use, centrifuge briefly to
collect the solution at the bottom of the tube, and gently mix with a pipette.
Try to avoid creating bubbles during mixing, and then pipette slowly and
accurately. Ensure that the SYBR Green One-Step Reaction Buffer (2X) is
completely thawed and mixed gently by inverting before use. If the
amplification fragment is long or the RNA structure is complex, pre-treat the
template RNA at 65ºC for 5-10 minutes to improve the reverse transcription
efficiency. This reaction uses the qPCR Reverse Primer as the gene-specific
primer for reverse transcription. Do not use Random Hexamer Primer or
Oligo(dT) Primer, which are commonly used for cDNA first-strand synthesis. Pay
attention to the primer annealing temperature. If the annealing temperature is
<60ºC, it is recommended to use a three-step PCR amplification. This product
contains SYBR Green I fluorescent dye. Protect it from strong light exposure
during storage and when setting up the PCR reaction to prevent fluorescence
quenching. For amplification fragments longer than 350bp or with a high GC
content, it's recommended to increase the extension time to 60 seconds or use
a three-step method to improve the amplification efficiency. Testing has shown
that repeated freeze-thaw cycles (up to 10 times) have no significant effect
on the product's performance. However, avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles as
much as possible, as it may reduce product efficiency. qPCR detection is
highly sensitive. Although this product offers excellent contamination
prevention, the PCR reaction setup area should still avoid any potential
contamination from amplifiable products. Discard PCR products in sealed
containers to prevent contamination of the experimental environment by high-
concentration PCR products. This product is for scientific research use by
professionals only. It should not be used for clinical diagnosis or treatment,
in food or drugs, and should not be stored in regular residences. For your
safety and health, please wear a lab coat and use disposable gloves when
handling. Related: Probe One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (20X, UDG) Multiplex Probe qPCR

UNG (Uracil-N-glycosylase), catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond
between the uracil (dU) base in DNA and deoxyribose, releasing free uracil. It
is mainly used to mitigate product contamination issues during PCR
amplification. Its anti-contamination mechanism involves incorporating dUTP
into DNA during PCR, producing dU-containing amplified products. In subsequent
PCR reactions, the UDG enzyme selectively cleaves dU-containing single or
double-stranded DNA, minimizing negative effects from previous PCR product
contaminations. The SYBR Green qPCR Mix (2X, UDG) utilizes SYBR Green I dye,
which binds to the minor groove of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The
fluorescence of free SYBR Green I is relatively weak, but intensifies upon
binding to dsDNA. This enables quantification of the amount of dsDNA produced
during PCR based on fluorescence intensity. The included Hotstart Taq DNA
Polymerase in this product is of premium quality and is heat-activated. It's
complexed with an antibody that inhibits the Taq enzyme's DNA polymerase
activity, effectively preventing non-specific annealing of primers and
template DNA or primer dimerization at lower temperatures. During the PCR's
denaturation step, the antibody is deactivated by heat, ensuring the Taq
enzyme's activity is only released post-denaturation. This significantly
enhances the PCR reaction's specificity, sensitivity, and quantification
accuracy. This product encompasses all generic components, including Hotstart
Taq DNA Polymerase, UDG enzyme, PCR Buffer, dNTPs, dUTP, SYBR Green I
fluorescent dye, stabilizers, and magnesium ions, making operations simpler
and usage more convenient. Users only need to supply primers, sample DNA, and
deionized water. ROX Dye The role of ROX dye is to correct fluorescence
fluctuations unrelated to PCR, thereby minimizing inter-well variability. This
variation might be caused by factors such as pipetting errors and sample
evaporation. Different quantitative PCR instruments have varying requirements
for ROX. Depending on the specific instrument in use, one should choose a SYBR
Green qPCR Mix (2X, UDG) containing either a high concentration of ROX (High
ROX), a low concentration of ROX (Low ROX), or no ROX. Typically, the SYBR
Green qPCR Mix containing a high concentration of ROX can also be used for
fluorescence quantitative PCR instruments that don't require ROX or require a
low concentration of ROX. Storage Store at -20ºC in a dark place, effective
for one year; Store at 4ºC in the dark, effective for one month. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Precautions Before use, ensure the entire tube of
reagent is fully thawed. Invert and gently mix before using. During mixing,
avoid creating bubbles. Pay attention to the annealing temperature of primers.
When the annealing temperature is <60ºC, it is recommended to use a three-step
PCR amplification. This product contains SYBR Green I fluorescent dye. Avoid
exposure to strong light when storing this product or setting up PCR reactions
to minimize fluorescence quenching issues. For amplification fragments
exceeding 350bp or with a high GC content, it is suggested to extend the
elongation time to 60 seconds or use a three-step method to enhance
amplification efficiency. Tests show that thawing and refreezing this product
up to 10 times does not significantly affect its performance. However, avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles as they might degrade the product's performance.
qPCR detection is ultra-sensitive. Although this product has excellent
contamination prevention, areas where PCR reactions are set up should still
avoid contamination from potential amplification products. PCR products should
be sealed and discarded to prevent contaminating the experimental environment
with highly concentrated PCR products. This product is for scientific research
use by professionals only. It is not for clinical diagnosis or treatment, not
for use in food or drugs, and should not be stored in ordinary residences. For
your safety and health, wear a lab coat and use disposable gloves when

RT-LAMP vs LAMP - Isothermal Amp Return to site Return to site RT-LAMP vs LAMP
A Comparative Analysis of RT-LAMP (Reverse Transcription Loop-mediated
Isothermal Amplification) and LAMP (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification)
Techniques in Nucleic Acid Amplification · Isothermal Amp Nucleic acid
amplification techniques have revolutionized the field of molecular
diagnostics, enabling rapid and sensitive detection of specific DNA or RNA
sequences. Among these techniques, RT-LAMP (Reverse Transcription Loop-
mediated Isothermal Amplification) and LAMP (Loop-mediated Isothermal
Amplification) stand out for their simplicity, sensitivity, and speed. This
article aims to provide a comparative analysis of these two methods,
highlighting their mechanisms, applications, and significance in various
fields. LAMP (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification): LAMP is a powerful
nucleic acid amplification method that operates under isothermal conditions,
typically around 60-65°C. It involves the amplification of DNA using a DNA
polymerase and a set of four to six primers that recognize multiple distinct
regions on the target DNA. This technique is highly specific and sensitive,
capable of producing a large amount of amplified DNA within 30-60 minutes.
LAMP products can be detected visually through turbidity or using fluorescent
dyes. Due to its rapidity and sensitivity, LAMP has found widespread
applications in clinical diagnostics, environmental testing, and food safety.
RT-LAMP (Reverse Transcription Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification): RT-
LAMP is a variation of LAMP that incorporates a reverse transcription step
before amplification, allowing the detection of RNA targets. In RT-LAMP, RNA
is first reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using a reverse
transcriptase enzyme, and then the cDNA is amplified using LAMP. Operating
under similar isothermal conditions, RT-LAMP offers rapid and sensitive
detection of RNA targets, making it particularly valuable in the detection of
RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Like LAMP, RT-LAMP has been utilized in
various diagnostic settings due to its simplicity and speed. Comparative
Analysis: While both LAMP and RT-LAMP share the advantages of rapidity,
sensitivity, and simplicity, they differ primarily in their target
specificity. LAMP amplifies DNA targets directly, while RT-LAMP amplifies RNA
targets through a reverse transcription step. This key distinction makes RT-
LAMP indispensable in the detection of RNA viruses and other RNA-based
targets, widening its scope of applications in molecular diagnostics and
research. However, both techniques offer benefits such as isothermal
amplification, eliminating the need for sophisticated thermocycling equipment
and reducing assay time. In conclusion, RT-LAMP and LAMP techniques represent
significant advancements in nucleic acid amplification, providing rapid,
sensitive, and specific detection of DNA and RNA targets. While LAMP is
suitable for amplifying DNA targets directly, RT-LAMP extends this capability
to RNA targets through a reverse transcription step. Both methods have
contributed significantly to various fields including clinical diagnostics,
infectious disease surveillance, environmental monitoring, and beyond. As
molecular diagnostic technologies continue to evolve, RT-LAMP and LAMP remain
pivotal tools in the arsenal of researchers and healthcare professionals for
efficient and accurate nucleic acid detection. At SBS Genetech , our

for your understanding. Since the advent of the Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) method, particularly with the continuous development of real-time
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) technology, nucleic acid amplification techniques have
permeated various fields of biological science. Recombinase Polymerase
Amplification (RPA), developed by the UK-based TwistDx Inc. in 2006, is an
isothermal amplification technology that has rapidly advanced in recent years.
This technique boasts advantages such as rapidity, sensitivity, excellent
specificity, and suitability for on-site rapid detection. It has been applied
successfully in diverse areas, including the detection of genetically modified
organisms, various pathogens, and food safety. Reaction Principle The RPA
reaction primarily relies on the recombinase UvsX and the recombinase loading
factor UvsY (auxiliary protein) derived from the T4 bacteriophage, along with
the Single-Stranded DNA-Binding Protein (SSB) Gp32, and the strand-displacing
DNA polymerase Bsu (Bacillus subtilis Pol) or Sau (Staphylococcus aureus Pol).
The amplification of the template is achieved based on the T4 bacteriophage's
nucleic acid replication mechanism. Initially, in the presence of Adenosine
Triphosphate (ATP), the primer forms a nucleoprotein filament complex with the
recombinase UvsX. This complex bi-directionally scans the target double-
stranded DNA for homologous sequences. Once a homologous sequence is found,
the recombinase dissociates the double-stranded DNA at this position, forming
a D-loop structure. One side of the D-loop remains double-stranded, undergoing
strand displacement, while the other side becomes single-stranded, stabilized
by the SSB protein Gp32. Subsequently, the nucleoprotein filament complex
actively hydrolyzes ATP, causing a conformational change and exposing the 3'
end of the primer. At this point, the DNA polymerase Bsu binds to the 3' end
of the primer, initiating the DNA amplification reaction and forming a new
complementary strand. In this reaction, the processes mediated by forward and
reverse primers occur simultaneously. The newly formed single strand pairs
with the original strand, generating a complete amplicon. This amplification
process repeats continuously, leading to exponential growth of the
amplification product. The entire process is typically completed within 20
minutes. During the reaction, competition exists between the SSB protein and
UvsX for primer binding sites. The auxiliary protein UvsY can invade the
primer-covered binding sites of the SSB protein, preventing the recombination
phenomenon that occurs when the SSB protein binds to the primer, and it can
facilitate the binding of UvsX to the primer, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Schematic Diagram of Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA)
Types of RPA Detection Methods Basic RPA Detection Basic RPA detection is a
nucleic acid detection method that combines RPA technology with agarose gel
electrophoresis. The main detection process involves performing RPA
amplification reaction under constant temperature conditions (37-39°C) for
20-40 minutes. After the reaction is completed, agarose gel electrophoresis is
used to detect the RPA amplification products. Components such as recombinase
and single-stranded binding protein in the RPA reaction system can bind to the
amplification products, inhibiting their migration in the gel. This can lead
to smear patterns in gel electrophoresis results. To avoid this, phenol and
chloroform are added to the amplification products in a 1:1 volume ratio. The
products are then extracted, and the extracted amplification products are
subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. Similar to the gel electrophoresis
process for PCR products, RPA amplification products are mixed with nucleic
acid dyes like EB before gel electrophoresis. The presence or absence of bands
and their sizes on the gel determine the detection results of the target
nucleic acid. Recombinase Polymerase Amplification with Lateral Flow Dipstick
(RPA-LFD) RPA-LFD is a nucleic acid detection method that combines RPA
technology with lateral flow dipstick (LFD). In comparison to the basic RPA
detection method, the RPA-LFD reaction system includes a DNA endonuclease
(nfo), an nfo probe, and a downstream primer labeled with biotin. The nfo
probe is approximately 50 nt long, with a FAM fluorescent group at the 5' end,
a blocking group (typically C3spacer) at the 3' end, and a tetrahydrofuran
(THF) molecule in the middle, as shown in Figure 2. The DNA endonuclease nfo
recognizes the THF molecule in the nfo probe and cleaves it. After cleavage,
the probe produces a free hydroxyl end, acting as an upstream primer. This new
upstream primer, along with the biotin-labeled downstream primer, undergoes
amplification to yield an amplification product with a FAM group at the 5' end
and biotin at the 3' end. This amplification product can be detected using a
lateral flow dipstick. Figure 2: Schematic Diagram of the Structure of the nfo
Probe LFD, based on lateral flow chromatography, immunology, and colloidal
gold technologies, is a type of test strip. The strip is mainly composed of
three parts: the sample pad, detection line, and control line. The sample pad
contains colloidal gold particles labeled with anti-FAM antibodies, the
detection line has a ligand with biotin, and the control line has another
antibody that can bind to anti-FAM antibodies. The specific detection
principle of LFD is illustrated in Figure 3. Firstly, the FAM groups on the
amplification product bind to the anti-FAM antibodies on the sample pad,
forming an immune complex. Then, all colloidal gold particles migrate to the
detection line under the action of the buffer solution. When they reach the
detection line, the biotin on the amplification product is captured by the
biotin ligand on the detection line, causing the amplification product to
aggregate. This aggregation results in the appearance of a red band on the
detection line. Colloidal gold particles that fail to bind to the
amplification product continue to migrate beyond the detection line. When they
reach the control line, the anti-FAM antibodies on the colloidal gold
particles bind to the antibodies on the control line, leading to the
aggregation of colloidal gold particles and the appearance of a red band on
the control line. The presence of a red band on the control line indicates the
completion of LFD detection. Therefore, when the test result is positive, two
red bands can be observed on the LFD – one on the detection line and one on
the control line. When the result is negative, only a red band on the control
line is visible on the LFD. Currently, LFD can be combined with various
nucleic acid amplification technologies such as LAMP, RCA, and RPA for the
detection of target nucleic acids. The advantage of RPA-LFD lies in its simple
operation, absence of complex instruments, and the ability to directly observe
the detection results with the naked eye, making it suitable for on-site rapid
testing. Figure 3: Schematic Diagram of LFD Detection Principle Real-time
Fluorescent RPA Detection The real-time fluorescent RPA detection method is a
nucleic acid detection approach that combines RPA technology with real-time
fluorescent detection technology. In comparison to the basic RPA detection
method's reaction system, the real-time fluorescent RPA reaction system
incorporates the nucleic acid endonuclease exo and exo probes. The exo probe
is a probe with a size of 46-52 nt, featuring a pair of thymine bases, each
carrying a fluorescent group and a quenching group. These thymine bases are
separated by a THF spacer, and the 3' end of the probe is connected to a
blocking group. The specific structure of the probe is illustrated in Figure
4. The fluorescent group in the probe is generally FAM, the quenching group is
typically BHQ, and the blocking group is commonly C3spacer. The nucleic acid
endonuclease exo can recognize THF molecules in the exo probe and, after
hybridization of the exo probe with the amplification product, cleave the THF
molecule. This cleavage separates the fluorescent and quenching groups in the
probe, leading to the generation of fluorescence. Equipment capable of real-
time monitoring of fluorescent signals can be used to detect the fluorescence
intensity during the reaction process, allowing for the determination of the
detection results for the target nucleic acid. Figure 4: Schematic Diagram of
the Structure of the exo Probe Currently, real-time fluorescent RPA detection
methods have found widespread application in pathogen detection, food safety,
and other fields. In comparison to basic RPA detection methods and RPA-LFD
methods, the real-time fluorescent RPA detection method offers notable
advantages with a shorter detection time, completing within 20 minutes.
Additionally, it exhibits high specificity and sensitivity. Figure 5:
Simplified Diagram of LFD-RPA Applications of RPA Since its inception, the RPA
technology has been applied in various fields such as single-gene mutation
detection, water sources, food safety, infectious disease detection, as well
as the detection of common pathogens in agriculture and animal husbandry. 1\.
Bacterial Detection Traditional bacterial cultivation is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and susceptible to contamination. RPA technology has shown
significant advantages in bacterial detection. For instance, E. coli, a normal
flora in the human intestinal tract, can cause severe enteritis and diarrhea
when consumed through contaminated food. Liu Jingwen and others utilized RT-
RPA with exo probes at 37°C to qualitatively detect E. coli within 20 minutes,
achieving a significantly shorter detection time compared to traditional
methods. The method also demonstrated a low detection limit of 0.01ng/μl,
providing technical support for rapid clinical diagnosis. Wang et al.
developed a dual-detection biosensor based on RPA and a three-stage lateral
flow strip. The biosensor performed dual-chain RPA reactions for Vibrio
cholerae and Vibrio vulnificus. This method boasts high sensitivity,
specificity, short reaction time, and simplicity, making it suitable for
grassroots hospitals and real-time on-site detection. 2\. Virus Detection RPA
technology is applicable for the immediate detection of various viruses
without cross-contamination. Yehia combined RPA technology with reverse
transcription to establish a detection method for the H5N1 virus,
demonstrating high sensitivity capable of detecting 1 copy of viral RNA.
Behrman integrated RPA technology with real-time fluorescence detection for a
rapid detection method of novel coronaviruses, achieving results within 15-20
minutes for 7 copies of viral RNA. RPA technology is also applicable to the
detection of Monkeypox virus, Newcastle disease virus, Spring viremia of carp
virus, African swine fever virus, Canine parvovirus, and others. 3\. Parasite
Detection In the realm of parasite detection, RPA methods have been
established for protozoa, nematodes, trematodes, and other parasites. Kersting
et al. targeted the amplification of the 18S rRNA gene fragment of the malaria
parasite using RPA-LFD, demonstrating high specificity and sensitivity under
mild reaction conditions. This method is suitable for on-site inspections in
remote areas, contributing to global progress in malaria prevention and
control. Guo Qinghong developed an RPA-LFD detection method for diagnosing
Japanese schistosomiasis in mice and sheep using the G01 fragment. The method
exhibited high sensitivity (97.22% for mice, 93.75% for sheep) and 100%
specificity for negative samples, showing no cross-reactivity with other
flukes. The results indicate that the RPA-LFD method has high specificity and
sensitivity for detecting Japanese schistosomiasis. 4\. Food Safety Detection
RPA technology is widely applied in food safety detection. Choi established a
detection method for Vibrio parahaemolyticus using RPA, achieving detection
within 20 minutes. Tang developed a real-time fluorescent RPA detection method
for Vibrio cholerae, capable of detecting 5 copies of bacterial DNA within 20
minutes. Additionally, RPA technology is utilized for the screening and
detection of genetically modified crops, with Chandu developing real-time
fluorescent RPA and RPA-LFD detection methods for genetically modified
soybeans. Conclusion Compared to PCR and other isothermal amplification
methods, RPA technology features isothermal amplification, rapidity,
sensitivity, specificity, ease of result interpretation, and operational
simplicity. It offers an economical solution that can be used under limited
resource conditions, presenting extensive development prospects. However,
there is currently no dedicated primer design software for RPA, and many
primers used in experiments may still be those used in traditional PCR,
potentially introducing experimental errors. With further research on RPA
technology, it is expected to mature and better fulfill its role in the
future. Subscribe Previous What Is Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification Used

Return to site Revolutionizing Molecular Diagnostics: Unveiling the Power of
Lyophilization with SBS Genetech In-depth Insights into Lyophilization
Techniques, From In Situ to Innovative Lyophilized Beads, Redefining the
Future of Molecular Diagnostics · Freeze-drying Lyophilization, also known as
freeze drying, is not a new topic in the field of biology. As early as 1890,
Richard Altmann first conducted lyophilization of biological organs. With the
development of vacuum equipment, lyophilization technology has been widely
applied in modern pharmaceuticals and bioproducts, such as blood products,
vaccines, antibiotics, and various applications in the food industry. With the
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for lyophilization in the in
vitro diagnostics (IVD) field has been increasing. In addition to meeting the
basic requirements of point-of-care testing (POCT), lyophilized products in
the IVD field have several advantages: Cost Reduction: Lyophilization can
reduce costs on multiple levels. Well-processed lyophilized products can be
stored at room temperature for an extended period, reducing the need for cold
storage construction costs, corresponding compliance monitoring costs, and the
energy consumption costs of the cold storage itself. Additionally,
lyophilization can lower the logistics costs of cold chain transportation,
including requirements for cold chain packaging, carbon emission regulations,
and material degradation costs. Convenience of Use: Adopting the form of
quantitative lyophilization allows end-users to avoid traditional steps such
as thawing and reconstitution of reagents, providing convenience, time
savings, and reduced operational errors for customers. Well-processed
lyophilized products can achieve rapid reconstitution, enabling instant use.
Extended Shelf Life: According to literature reports, lyophilized products
with good processes can have a shelf life of up to twenty years. In general,
well-formulated and well-processed molecular diagnostic reagents can be stored
at room temperature for more than two years, meeting the stringent expiration
date requirements of end-users. Regarding the choice between in situ
lyophilization and lyophilized beads: Lyophilization itself is a process
issue, and there are many paths from the beginning to the end of
lyophilization. The exploration of lyophilization processes (good processes)
is not only about ensuring the consistency and stability of product quality
but also about minimizing the lyophilization process and energy consumption.
Lyophilization processes are related not only to lyophilization equipment,
environment, lyophilized products themselves, and formulation of protective
agents but also to the form of lyophilization. In the IVD field, the most
common forms of lyophilization are in situ lyophilization and lyophilized
beads. In situ lyophilization involves placing the liquid directly in the
packaging container for lyophilization, also known as in-place lyophilization.
It is a very mature lyophilization system with a history of over a hundred
years in the lyophilization field. Because lyophilization occurs within the
container, there are high requirements for the container. For example, in the
pharmaceutical industry, the widely used vials, such as vials for penicillin,
have different manufacturing processes—molded vials and tubing vials. However,
tubing vials are mainly used for lyophilization. Compared to molded vials,
tubing vials have better contact with the bottom and uniform wall thickness.
Uniform wall thickness ensures stable and uniform heat exchange during
lyophilization, which is crucial for ensuring lyophilization stability and
reliability. In the early stages of the IVD field, many immunoassay,
biochemical, and coagulation reagents were also lyophilized using vials. Its
characteristic is multi-dose lyophilization, reconstitution before use,
effectively solving the problem of cold chain transportation. As globalization
has accelerated the demand for molecular diagnostic reagents among different
countries worldwide, the associated transportation costs and environmental
pressures have also placed significant demands on lyophilization. The demand
for lyophilization in the molecular diagnostic field is particularly urgent,
and in situ lyophilization is the most easily thought of solution, with
satisfactory results currently. However, in situ lyophilization cannot escape
the requirements for flat-bottom bottles. As a result, people have attempted
in situ lyophilization directly using PCR tubes. In this process, there are
various issues related to process control, batch-to-batch variation, inter-
batch variation, large gaps, and limited production capacity. Why lyophilized
beads? Looking globally, lyophilized beads are a prominent method in the
lyophilization of molecular diagnostics. Essentially, it solves several
problems: Individual Packaging: Achieves individual packaging for single-dose
use. Distribution after Lyophilization: Allows for redistribution after
lyophilization. Mass Production Capability: Solves the issue of mass
production capacity. However, the lyophilization of beads has changed the
original form of liquid distribution and mass production for IVD. Currently,
there is no particularly professional equipment and skilled operators for
matching, which has become a bottleneck limiting the industry's development.
For lyophilized bead production, the process can be roughly divided into the
following stages: Formula Optimization: Optimizing the formula involves
creating stable and well-shaped beads, considering the requirements for
moisture desorption during lyophilization, and determining the impact of
additives on signal enhancement or attenuation in subsequent experiments.
Commonly used sugars, mannitol, etc., all play a role, but whether they can be
used in a specific formula and the required concentration are crucial for the
entire diagnostic system and require exploration. Bead Production Process: The
bead production process requires precise control of droplet dosing and
continuous production. Currently, some domestic companies are attempting to
develop similar equipment, but there is a gap in the understanding of the
inspection industry by equipment manufacturers. For practitioners in the
biological field, understanding the use and control logic of fluid-related
equipment requires a high level of knowledge, and precision fluid control
equipment often needs adjustment to adapt to different viscosities,
formulations, and surfactants. Exploration of Drying Curves: The exploration
of drying curves is an operation that combines experience and practice
throughout the process. There are many mature lyophilizers on the market that
can serve as reference equipment, but to develop equipment that meets or
adapts to small beads, the basic framework structure must be understood in the
entire process. When necessary, equipment may need to be modified to improve
production capacity, energy consumption, and equipment applicability. Low-
temperature drying is the best for preserving the activity of the material
compared to other drying methods. In the entire equipment, considerations must
be given to the shape and arrangement of the drying vacuum chamber, as well as
the location, size, and water absorption of the desiccant chamber. Common
lyophilizers use a low-temperature cold trap to capture moisture in the
material, which places high demands on moisture capture. The drying process is
divided into primary drying (MD) and secondary drying (SD), and the conditions
for primary drying must match the shape of our formulated liquid. For example,
before designing a program, it is necessary to measure eutectic points,
melting points, etc. Generally, the drying temperature of the main formulation
is kept lower than the eutectic point to effectively control and improve the
collapse and surface pitting of beads during the drying process. After MD,
there is often some bound water in the bead product that could not be frozen
earlier, and it is dried again during the SD process. However, in many tests,
it has been found that there is a certain predetermined value for the drying
of SD. If this predetermined value is exceeded, it may cause damage to the
activity of the product. Experience and necessary means help find the best
drying curve. Control of Filling Humidity: After drying, the product has a low
water content. Taking molecular diagnostics as an example, it can generally
maintain long-term stability, with a water content of around 3%. This places
high demands on the control of filling humidity. To ensure the stability of
the entire process, the environmental humidity during filling generally needs
to be controlled below 5%. This places very high demands on the factory's
environment and energy consumption. Different means of humidity control place
high demands on the rate of dehumidification, final humidity retention, energy
consumption, and cost control. The filling speed also affects the stability of
the operation. Therefore, automated equipment and related tools become
particularly important, but different consumables and bead sizes and
characteristics need to be considered during the design of the equipment. For
bead production, quality control after mass production is critical. For well-
explored processes and parameters, after producing well-shaped beads, it is
necessary to conduct random testing of the water content and functionality of
the beads. It may be necessary to retain samples for aging and accelerated
testing. For water content testing, mature methods include weight analysis,
Karl Fischer titration, thermogravimetric analysis, and infrared spectroscopy.
Only by paying attention to all links in the entire chain can we ensure the
stability and suitability of our process and the final long-term storage. In

5 Features to Look for When Comparing Different Types o... Return to site
Return to site 5 Features to Look for When Comparing Different Types of Bst
Polymerases Amplification speed, reverse transcription activity, impurity
tolerance, specificity, and what August 22, 2022 · Isothermal Amp When it
comes to finding the best Bst Polymerase for your research, it’s tempting to
look at the polymerase with the highest amplification speed, reverse
transcription activity, impurity tolerance, and specificity. But inevitably,
cost becomes a factor. Researchers have to consider which options are most
affordable while meeting the needs. Today’s midrange Bst Polymerases like Bst
DNA Polymerase offer great performance. Compared with wild-type Bst DNA
polymerase (large fragment), Bst DNA Polymerase has been greatly improved in
terms of amplification speed, yield, salt tolerance, and thermal stability.
Therefore, it is an excellent enzyme for most isothermal amplification. But
how do you know which affordable Bst Polymerase is best for you and your
research? As you search for the right fit, look out for these 5 must-know
features that will have the greatest impact on your productivity while staying
within budget: Amplification Speed Amplification speed is very important as it
can help to shorten the experimental time, resulting in higher research
efficiency. The wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large fragment) has a
comparatively low amplification speed, so the detection time takes long time.
Fortunately, with electronic reconstruction and e nzyme evolution technology,
the performance can be largely improved, including the amplification speed.
Wild-type Bst DNA Polymerase (Large Fragment):🌟 Bst DNA Polymerase ：🌟🌟 Bst
Polymerase ：🌟🌟🌟🌟 Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase ：🌟🌟🌟🌟 Reverse Transcription Activity
Reverse transcription activity is extremely important when you are using RNA
templates. The wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large fragment) and Bst DNA
Polymerase have very limited reverse transcription activity, so they are not
suitable for the RNA samples. With genetic engineering, Bst Polymerase has
strong reverse transcription activity and can carry out reverse transcription
without any other enzymes. Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is a mixture of Bst
Polymerase and extremely thermostable reverse transcriptase (65°C tolerant).
With addition of reverse transcriptase, it is even more suitable for the
isothermal amplification reaction of RNA. Low-sensitivity RNA molecules can be
detected with Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase. Wild-type Bst DNA Polymerase (Large
Fragment):🌟 Bst DNA Polymerase ：🌟 Bst Polymerase ：🌟🌟🌟 Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase
：🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Impurity Tolerance The impurities in samples can greatly impact the
amplification of the enzymes. Without optimization, wild-type Bst DNA
polymerase (large fragment) has poor performance when there are contaminations
in the sample, resulting in the failure of the detection. Fortunately, with
electronic reconstruction and enzyme evolution technology, the impurity
tolerance can be largely improved. Wild-type Bst DNA Polymerase (Large
Fragment):🌟 Bst DNA Polymerase ：🌟🌟 Bst Polymerase ：🌟🌟🌟🌟 Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase
：🌟🌟🌟🌟 Specificity Specificity is an important parameter to evaluate the
ability of a screening test to detect a true negative or positive. With high-
speed amplification characteristics, the wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large
fragment) will inevitably lead to false positive amplification, especially
when primers are at high concentration, resulting in low specificity.
Fortunately, with genetic engineering, higher specificity can be achieved.
Besides, the engineered enzyme has a strong recognition ability to dUTP. The
dTTP needed for amplification reaction can be completely replaced by dUTP, so
the amplification products all contain dUTP. By adding Heat-Labile Uracil DNA
Glycosylase (HL-UDG) , aerosol pollutants will be completely removed in the
initial reaction stage. The HL-UDG can be later inactivated irreversibly
within 3 min at 65°C, which not only eliminates the pollutants but also
ensures the normal amplification of nucleic acid. Therefore, the false
positive caused by aerosol pollution in the reaction can be greatly reduced.
Wild-type Bst DNA Polymerase (Large Fragment):🌟 Bst DNA Polymerase ：🌟🌟🌟🌟 Bst
Polymerase ：🌟🌟🌟🌟 Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase ：🌟🌟🌟🌟 Whether This Enzyme is
Lyophilizable Freeze drying or lyophilization technology has been widely used
in the fields of medicine, biological products, food, blood products and
active substances, and has been gradually applied in enzyme reagents. The
advantages of freeze drying are as follows: Stable structure The biological
activity is basically unchanged Porous, with good rehydration and good
efficacy Eliminates 95% ~ 99% moisture and can be stored at room temperature
or in a refrigerator for a long time However, most Bst Polymerases on the
market are not ideal for lyophilization, as there are two prerequisites.
First, the enzyme shall have a high concentration. Second, the enzyme has to
be glycerol-free. At SBS Genetech, we provide both Bst Polymerase (glycerol-
free) and Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase (glycerol-free) which are lyophilizable.
Besides, we also offer Bst DNA/RNA Lyo Buffer . With this optimized buffer,
there is no need to optimize the conditions of the freeze-drying protective
agent. Subscribe Previous Bst Polymerase vs Taq Polymerase: How to Select

Start Your Rolling Circle Amplification At SBS Genetch, we are at the
forefront of offering solutions for RCA with advanced enzymes and primers
October 23, 2022 · Isothermal Amp Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) is an
isothermal amplification technology developed based on the circular pathogenic
microorganism DNA/RNA molecular rolling replication in nature. Using a small
segment of cyclic oligonucleotides as a template and dNTPs/NTPs as raw
materials, a long repetitive single-stranded DNA/RNA is produced by
amplification under the action of DNA/RNA polymerase. The amplification
methods include linear amplification and exponential amplification. RCA has
been widely used in genomics, proteomics, molecular diagnosis, biosensors,
drug development, and other fields. Operating Principle of RCA The template of
RCA must be circular. If linear genes are amplified, padlock probes are
required. Both ends of the padlock probe have complementary sequences with the
target gene. The target gene is identified by the padlock probe and combined
to form an incompletely closed cyclic oligonucleotide. The combination of the
padlock probe and the target gene can form a more stable topology to ensure
the stability of the connection product, and then a fully closed cyclic
oligonucleotide is formed under the action of the ligase. If the template
itself is a cyclic single-stranded oligonucleotide, this process is not
required. The two most common amplification processes are described below.
Linear amplification : the positive primer recognizes the pairing sequence of
the circular template, and under the action of phi29 DNA polymerase, the
repetitive linear single-stranded DNA sequence is synthesized. This single-
stranded DNA contains hundreds or thousands of repetitive template
complementary fragments. Exponential amplification : On the basis of linear
amplification, a reverse primer is added. This primer can combine with a
linear single-stranded DNA sequence. Under the function of phi29 DNA
polymerase's strand displacement, it can form a multi-branch amplification
reaction, making the product increase exponentially. Important Components of
RCA Primers Padlock probe : It has a complementary sequence with the target
gene and combines with the target gene to form an incomplete closed loop.
Forward primer: Identify the pairing sequence of the circular template and
conduct linear amplification of RCA. Reverse primer: Identify the linear
single-stranded sequence of linear amplification product and conduct RCA
exponential amplification. Enzymes DNA ligase: connect the two ends of the
incomplete lock ring to form a completely closed circular template. phi29 DNA
polymerase: Thermostable DNA polymerase cloned from Bacillus subtilis phage
phi29 , characterized by strong strand displacement activity and continuous
synthesis reaction. Key Points of RCA The RCA detection template should be a
single-stranded circular structure. If it is linear DNA, it should be
cyclized. For circular RNA templates, RNA reverse transcription is not
required. phi29 DNA polymerase can catalyze DNA polymerization at room
temperature, so RCA can react at 30°C or room temperature. The amplification
efficiency of linear amplification can reach 10 5 times, and that of
exponential amplification can reach 10 9 times. RCA has high specificity and
is suitable for SNP detection. The products obtained from the phosphorylation
of RCA products can be directly used for sequencing. Solutions of SBS Genetech
phi29 HT DNA polymerase phi29 HT DNA polymerase phi29 HT DNA polymerase is an
updated version of phi29 DNA polymerase. In addition to the strong strand
displacement and continuous synthesis (> 70kb) activity of phi29 DNA
polymerase, phi29 HT DNA polymerase can continuously synthesize DNA at 42°C,
while the activity of phi29 DNA polymerase is very low at this temperature. In
addition, phi29 HT DNA Polymerase still has a strong 3 '- 5' exonuclease
proofreading function and the fidelity of the synthesized DNA fragments is
high. The exonuclease activity of this enzyme is strong, so the primer needs
3'- end thio-modification in the process of synthesis to reduce the cleavage
effect of the exonuclease activity on the primer. The high-temperature
reaction characteristic of phi29 HT DNA Polymerase has the following
advantages: In the next generation sequencing (NGS), the enzyme has stronger
amplification activity for complex templates such as high GC content and
palindrome structure, which makes the coverage of NGS more uniform and reduces
the depth required for sequencing. High-temperature reaction conditions
improve the synthesis of WGA products of genomic DNA and can be used for
variable temperature amplification. The gap region in sequencing is reduced,
which can improve the quality and integrity of the data from single-cell
sequencing. Reduce non-specific amplification products. Improve the
amplification performance and specificity of MDA/RCA and other experiments.
Custom DNA Oligonucleotides For single-stranded linear oligonucleotides, the
most important part of the cyclization process is the design of the padlock
probe. The two ends of the padlock probe are specifically complementary to the
target gene sequence. When there is a mismatch, the probe connection cannot be
completed. High-quality probes can ensure the high specificity of DNA/RNA
amplification. At SBS Genetech, we provide guidance on the design of the
padlock probe and combines it with the unique primer synthesis platform of RCA
to ensure the formation of a high-quality cyclic oligonucleotide template for
the amplification reaction. Besides, SBS Genetech is recognized as one of the
global major leading industry players in Oligonucleotide Synthesis by third-
party market researchers. For more details, please visit DNA Oligonucleotide

LAMP-CRISPR Technology: A Game-Changer in Point-of-Care... Return to site
Return to site LAMP-CRISPR Technology: A Game-Changer in Point-of-Care
Pathogen Detection Discover the Breakthrough Integration of LAMP and CRISPR
for Accurate and Rapid Point-of-Care Testing of Infectious Diseases May 16,
2023 · Isothermal Amp, CRISPR The primary objective of effectively managing
infectious diseases and epidemics is the prompt and accurate detection of
pathogens, with COVID-19 serving as a prime example. The significance and
demand for point-of-care (POC) testing have been particularly emphasized
during the ongoing pandemic. According to the World Health Organization, POC
testing should adhere to the ASSURED criteria, encompassing affordability,
sensitivity, specificity, user-friendliness, robustness, equipment-free
operation, and deliverability. Developing pathogen-specific POC tests that
fulfill all of these criteria poses a considerable challenge. Consequently, in
vitro diagnostic companies have been focusing their efforts on combining
existing technologies in recent years. Among the most revolutionary and
promising approaches is the integration of isothermal amplification with
CRISPR technology, which not only meets the ASSURED criteria but also
represents an ideal method for the development of a new generation of POC
diagnostics. This article will primarily provide a comprehensive overview of
the CRISPR technology based on LAMP and explore the following key aspects:
LAMP and CRISPR technology Rationale behind selecting the combination of LAMP
and CRISPR technology Application of LAMP-CRISPR technology in POC platforms
01 - LAMP (Loop-mediated isothermal amplification) LAMP, or loop-mediated
isothermal amplification, is a groundbreaking gene amplification method
invented by Dr. Masahiro Notomi of Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. in Japan in 2000.
This technique has gained significant attention due to its simplicity, speed,
accuracy, and cost-effectiveness in detecting pathogens across human, animal,
and agricultural samples. During the COVID-19 pandemic, LAMP technology has
experienced remarkable advancements with various improved methods used for
detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, marking a golden age for LAMP. The
distinguishing feature of LAMP lies in its utilization of 4-6 primers that
selectively target specific regions of DNA. The amplification process is
initiated by the Bst enzyme, possessing strand-displacement activity, and two
specially designed primers. This leads to the formation of loop structures,
resulting in the exponential production of DNA after successive amplification
cycles. Remarkably, LAMP can amplify 1-10 DNA copies into an abundant 10^9 -
10^10 copies within a timeframe of 15-60 minutes, showcasing its exceptional
sensitivity and specificity. One of the key advantages of LAMP is its
simplicity, as it does not necessitate temperature cycling like qPCR. The
amplification reaction is carried out at a constant temperature of 60-65°C,
and the results can be observed using various methods such as turbidity,
fluorescence, or probe-based techniques. This user-friendly approach enhances
the practicality and versatility of LAMP in diverse diagnostic applications.
02 - CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)
CRISPR, also known as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic
Repeats, is an RNA-based adaptive immune defense system. It utilizes spacer
sequences that exhibit similarity to viral or plasmid sequences, allowing it
to employ target-specific RNA to guide Cas proteins in the precise recognition
and correction of genetic errors in a wide range of organisms and cells. The
CRISPR/Cas system consists of a guide RNA (gRNA) sequence that serves as a
navigational tool for Cas proteins (CRISPR-associated nucleases) to target
specific regions within foreign genomic material: The gRNA, comprising
tracrRNA and crRNA regions, can be specifically designed to target desired
regions, affording the CRISPR/Cas system its programmability. Cas proteins,
acting in accordance with the gRNA, act as nucleases capable of recognizing
and cleaving target sequences in DNA or RNA. The CRISPR/Cas system represents
a remarkable and highly promising technology, applicable to gene editing and
molecular diagnostics. Through its programmable gRNA sequence, it allows for
precise targeting of any gene region. In the field of infectious disease
detection, its primary role lies in pathogen identification and nucleic acid-
based diagnostics facilitated by Cas proteins. Cas proteins are classified
into two main classes: Cas9, possessing target cleavage activity, and Cas12,
Cas13, and Cas14, exhibiting collateral cleavage activity upon target
recognition. Cas12 and Cas13 are commonly employed, with Cas12 cleaving non-
target single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and Cas13 cleaving single-stranded RNA
(ssRNA). CRISPR/Cas technology has revolutionized nucleic acid detection by
combining it with pre-amplification or post-amplification steps. This synergy
with PCR or isothermal amplification methods like LAMP, RPA, NASBA, and RCA
has ushered in a new era of molecular diagnostics, enabling highly sensitive
and specific detection of DNA and RNA. Notable examples include: CRISPR/Cas9
combined with NASBA technology, successfully applied for Zika virus detection
and lineage identification. CRISPR-Cas9 typing PCR (ctPCR), a pre-
amplification process for detecting HPV subtypes. The SHERLOCK system, gaining
popularity, which merges Cas13 with RPA in CRISPR/Cas technology, facilitating
molecular diagnostics of viruses like dengue fever and Zika virus. Cas14
enzyme combined with RCA, enabling detection of microRNA (miRNA) and single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). HOLMES, a fusion of CRISPR/Cas with PCR.
Cas12 combined with LAMP and RPA methods for pathogen-specific detection.
Initially known as the DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter
(DETECTR) method, this combined technique has gained traction in point-of-care
(POC) diagnostics. The application and development of DETECTR have led to an
increasing adoption of LAMP-based CRISPR/Cas technologies in pathogen
research. These combined approaches exemplify the versatility and immense
potential of CRISPR/Cas technology in advancing molecular diagnostics for
accurate pathogen detection. 03 - LAMP-CRISPR (Loop-mediated isothermal
amplification combined with CRISPR) LAMP-CRISPR represents a cutting-edge
molecular diagnostic technology that has emerged in recent years for pathogen
detection. This innovative approach combines the strengths of both techniques,
effectively overcoming their individual limitations. LAMP, known for its rapid
amplification capabilities, can be susceptible to false-positive results.
Factors such as incorrect primer design, DNA contamination, and suboptimal
reaction conditions (such as buffer pH, Mg concentration, or interfering dyes)
can compromise the assay's specificity and sensitivity. CRISPR/Cas technology,
on the other hand, leverages a reporter system to detect specific targets,
offering a powerful solution to mitigate the limitations of LAMP and minimize
the occurrence of false-positive results. This integration results in a highly
sensitive and specific diagnostic platform. By combining LAMP with CRISPR/Cas
technology, visualizing the results becomes feasible through fluorescence
chromatographic strips or direct visual inspection. This eliminates the need
for quantitative measurements typically required in other nucleic acid
detection methods. Consequently, this streamlined approach enables efficient,
sensitive, specific, and user-friendly point-of-care (POC) testing without the
requirement for complex equipment. In the combination of CRISPR/Cas with LAMP
technology, Cas12 endonucleases are particularly favored due to their
collateral cleavage activity. Cas12 enzymes encompass several subtypes,
including Cas12a, Cas12c, Cas12d, Cas12e, Cas12b, Cas12h, Cas12i, and Cas12g.
Among these subtypes, Cas12a and Cas12b are the most commonly employed in
LAMP-CRISPR detection, with Cas12a being the preferred choice. This preference
stems from the fact that Cas12b requires a lengthy single-guide RNA (sgRNA) of
111 nucleotides, which encompasses the crRNA and tracrRNA regions. The
extended sgRNA may potentially overlap with the LAMP primers designed to
target the specific region, leading to false-positive results. In contrast,
Cas12a utilizes a shorter gRNA of 41 nucleotides, which was originally
employed in the development of the DETECTR method. Cas13 has also found
utility in LAMP-CRISPR applications. As Cas13 cleaves single-stranded RNA
(ssRNA), an additional T7 transcription step is necessary when utilizing
Cas13. This step allows for the conversion of the pre-amplified DNA products
into RNA molecules. LAMP-CRISPR/Cas technology has been extensively utilized
for detecting a wide range of infectious viruses and bacteria. Remarkably,
this approach has exhibited exceptional specificity and sensitivity, reaching
up to 100% in pathogen detection assays. Moreover, LAMP-CRISPR outperforms the
gold standard qPCR by significantly reducing turnaround times, rendering it
highly suitable for rapid testing applications. However, it is important to
acknowledge that LAMP-CRISPR/Cas also has certain limitations, primarily due
to the requirement of two separate steps: the amplification process and the
CRISPR/Cas process. These steps involve different chemical components and
reaction conditions. LAMP amplification utilizes the Bst enzyme at
temperatures around 60-65 degrees Celsius, while the CRISPR reaction with Cas
enzymes typically occurs at approximately 37 degrees Celsius. This
necessitates the use of two different temperatures, which can potentially
increase the risk of contamination. Fortunately, there are strategies
available to overcome this limitation. For example, in HOLMESv2 detection, a
solution is found by utilizing a thermostable Cas12b enzyme derived from
Acidophilic Bacillus, enabling a single-tube reaction and eliminating the need
for different reaction temperatures. Another approach to minimize technical
demands and contamination risks for the operator involves sealing the LAMP
reagents at the bottom of the reaction tube with oil and covering the CRISPR
reagents with a reaction tube cap, facilitating a single-tube reaction. After
LAMP amplification, the tube is inverted to mix the contents and initiate the
CRISPR/Cas12a process. CRISPR/Cas technology can also be combined with PCR and
other isothermal methods, such as NASBA, RCA, and RPA. However, each of these
approaches has its limitations. PCR, for instance, is not ideal for point-of-
care (POC) diagnostic platforms due to the need for complex thermal cycling
equipment. Similarly to LAMP, other isothermal amplification methods do not
require complex equipment. However, they typically involve the use of two
primers and two or more enzymes. NASBA, for example, relies on three enzymes
for amplifying RNA or single-stranded DNA. Furthermore, the combination of
CRISPR and NASBA generally exhibits lower sensitivity compared to other
methods. In contrast, LAMP technology offers advantages in terms of lower
costs and operational complexity by utilizing a single Bst enzyme. Moreover,
LAMP provides higher specificity and efficiency by utilizing multiple primers.
RPA is widely used as well but requires an additional step to convert the
amplification products into RNA molecules. As a result, it is often combined
with the Cas13 enzyme. One of RPA's main advantages is its reaction
temperature, which closely matches that of the CRISPR reaction. However, it
has a major limitation in the lower concentration of amplification products
compared to CRISPR, leading to decreased sensitivity when the target
concentration is low. When combined with CRISPR, LAMP can generate high
concentrations of amplification products. Therefore, LAMP is preferred over
other isothermal methods for integration with CRISPR technology in POC
diagnostic platforms. 04 - LAMP-CRISPR in POC Applications Inspired by LAMP
technology's success in point-of-care (POC) platforms, LAMP-CRISPR POC devices
streamline the process into three stages: DNA/RNA extraction, LAMP
amplification, and CRISPR/Cas reaction. By integrating these steps into a
single tube, user convenience is maximized. Various POC platforms have
successfully implemented this approach. The key concept involves integrating
LAMP and CRISPR/Cas reactions on a microfluidic chip and using fluorescence
detection or lateral flow chromatography for result analysis. For instance, a
portable POC instrument is designed as a compact, rechargeable, and semi-
automated device measuring only 3.5cm x 3cm x 13cm. It finds applications in
mobile laboratories, airports, and quarantine areas. The instrument includes a
temperature-adjusting button to facilitate RT-LAMP amplification at 65°C and
CRISPR/Cas12a reaction at 37°C. Within a rapid 35-minute timeframe, it can
detect up to 10 samples, with results visually interpreted using
chromatographic paper. 05 - Solution of SBS Genetech SBS Genetech is proud to

proudly present the Bst P DNA/RNA Polymerase—an upgraded version achieved
through cutting-edge in silico design and in vitro evolution screening. This
enhanced polymerase is specifically tailored for LAMP or RT-LAMP amplification
of DNA or RNA. Key performance improvements include: Hot start Aptamer: With
an efficiency of over 95% in blocking enzyme activity below 30°C and complete
activity release within 1 minute above 60°C, the hot start Aptamer ensures
precise control over the reaction system. By enabling the establishment of the
system at room temperature, it significantly reduces non-specific
amplification at lower temperatures. Elevated reaction temperature: By raising
the reaction temperature to 70°C, the formation of primer dimers is

Enzymes A Deep Dive into Key Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Enzymes and
Cutting-Edge Production Solutions by SBS Genetech March 5, 2024 · Isothermal
Amp Enzymes for Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) are indispensable
components in the revolutionary molecular biology technique known as
Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA). This method has garnered immense
popularity due to its ability to rapidly amplify DNA or RNA targets under
isothermal conditions, typically between 37-42°C. Offering simplicity, speed,
and versatility, RPA finds applications across various fields including
diagnostics, research, and biotechnology. Let's delve deeper into the key
reagents commonly utilized in RPA: T4 UvsX Recombinase : Derived from the T4
bacteriophage, T4 UvsX Recombinase is a vital enzyme in RPA. It plays a
pivotal role in initiating the amplification process by facilitating the
strand exchange step. UvsX enables the binding of UvsX to single-stranded DNA
(ssDNA), a crucial step in amplification initiation. T4 UvsY Protein : Another
essential protein derived from the T4 bacteriophage, T4 UvsY Protein aids in
assembling the presynaptic filament. By promoting the binding of UvsX to ssDNA
and stimulating its recombinase activity, UvsY facilitates efficient
amplification in RPA. T4 Gene 32 Protein : Encoded by the T4 bacteriophage, T4
Gene 32 Protein serves as a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB). In RPA,
it plays a critical role in stabilizing ssDNA intermediates, preventing their
degradation, and facilitating subsequent steps in the amplification process.
Bsu DNA Polymerase : Also known as Bacillus subtilis DNA Polymerase, Bsu DNA
Polymerase is a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme derived from Bacillus
subtilis. It is employed in RPA to synthesize complementary DNA strands during
the amplification process. Sau DNA Polymerase : Derived from Staphylococcus
aureus, Sau DNA Polymerase is another DNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme
utilized in RPA for amplifying DNA targets. Functioning similarly to Bsu DNA
Polymerase, it synthesizes new DNA strands during the amplification process.
Exonuclease III : Exonuclease III is an enzyme catalyzing the removal of
nucleotides from DNA ends. In RPA, it aids in enhancing the specificity of the
amplification reaction by eliminating any unwanted DNA fragments or primers.
Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase : Bst (Bacillus stearothermophilus) DNA/RNA Polymerase
is an enzyme capable of synthesizing DNA from RNA templates (reverse
transcription) as well as DNA from DNA templates. Widely used in RPA, it
amplifies RNA targets directly or generates complementary DNA (cDNA) from RNA
templates for subsequent amplification. Endonuclease IV : Endonuclease IV is
an enzyme that cleaves DNA at apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites. It finds
application in RPA by creating nicks or breaks in DNA strands, facilitating
the initiation of DNA amplification. At SBS Genetech , leveraging over two

Why is Bst polymerase used in LAMP? - Isothermal Amp Return to site Return to
site Why is Bst polymerase used in LAMP? Delve deeper into the diverse range
of Bst polymerase variants developed by SBS Genetech, each uniquely engineered
to meet the demands of specific research objectives. March 23, 2024 ·
Isothermal Amp BST (Bacillus stearothermophilus) polymerase, commonly known as
Bst polymerase, is a staple in Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP)
for its tailored features that align perfectly with this technique: High
Thermal Stability: Bst polymerase boasts exceptional stability at elevated
temperatures, a must for LAMP reactions held consistently between 60°C to
65°C. This resilience allows it to endure the prolonged high temperatures
needed for DNA denaturation, annealing, and extension during amplification.
Robust Strand Displacement Activity: With robust strand displacement activity,
Bst polymerase efficiently displaces DNA strands ahead of the polymerization
process, streamlining DNA amplification without the need for thermal cycling.
This trait is vital for the continuous amplification nature of LAMP, where
displaced DNA strands act as templates for further amplification.
Amplification of Complex Templates: Bst polymerase excels in amplifying DNA
templates with intricate secondary structures, like hairpins or loops, often
encountered in LAMP reactions. Its robust strand displacement activity helps
navigate through these structures, ensuring efficient amplification of target
sequences. Isothermal Amplification Competence: Operating as an isothermal
amplification technique, LAMP functions at a constant temperature without
requiring complex thermal cycling equipment. Bst polymerase's ability to
operate optimally at a single, constant temperature simplifies experimental
setup, reducing reliance on sophisticated thermal cycling instruments, thus
making LAMP accessible for various applications, including field-based
diagnostics. Cost-effectiveness: In contrast to other DNA polymerases used in
PCR-based techniques, Bst polymerase is relatively inexpensive, making it an
attractive option for large-scale or resource-limited applications, such as
point-of-care diagnostics or field-based testing. In summary, BST polymerase's
unique blend of thermal stability, robust strand displacement activity, and
isothermal amplification capability positions it as an optimal enzyme for
LAMP, enabling swift and sensitive detection of target nucleic acid sequences
across various applications in research, diagnostics, and biotechnology. At
SBS Genetech, we've developed a range of novel Bst polymerase variants
tailored to enhance their utility in LAMP. Let's explore these innovative
solutions further. Bst DNA Polymerase Large Fragment: Cost-effective version
for conventional strand displacement reaction Bst DNA Polymerase Large
Fragment is the portion of the Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA Polymerase
protein that contains the 5´ → 3´ polymerase activity, but lacks 5´ →3´
exonuclease activity. It has basic strand displacement activity and can be
used for isothermal amplification. However, without further genetic
engineering, the amplification speed, impurity tolerance, and specificity of
Bst DNA Polymerase (Large Fragment) are not ideal. So we don't recommend this
enzyme for most of your experiments. Bst DNA Polymerase: Ideal for isothermal
amplification of DNA template Bst DNA Polymerase is also derived from Bacillus
stearothermophilus DNA polymerase I. Its 5 '- 3' exonuclease activity was
removed by genetic engineering, while the 5 '- 3' polymerase activity was
retained. As the name suggests, Bst DNA Polymerase has a strong strand-
displacement ability for DNA template, so it is an excellent enzyme for
isothermal amplification. Compared with wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large
fragment), Bst DNA Polymerase has been greatly improved in terms of
amplification speed, yield, salt tolerance, and thermal stability. At the same
time, Bst DNA Polymerase can be amplified with dUTP as substrate, while Bst
DNA Polymerase (Large Fragment) has no such activity. Bst Polymerase: For
isothermal amplification of both DNA and RNA template with a single enzyme
system Bst Polymerase is also derived from Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA
polymerase I. Its 5'- 3' and 3'-5' exonuclease activity was removed by genetic
engineering, while the 5'- 3' polymerase activity was retained. Compared with
wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large fragment) and Bst DNA Polymerase , Bst
Polymerase has better isothermal amplification activity and stronger reverse
transcription activity. Single enzyme system reaction can be realized in the
isothermal amplification experiment with RNA as a template. Bst Polymerase has
good reverse transcription activity at 60-65°C, which can effectively solve
the reverse transcription of the RNA template with secondary complex
structure, while Bst DNA Polymerase and wild-type Bst DNA polymerase (large
fragment) do not have this activity. Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase: Ideal for
isothermal amplification of RNA template Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is a mixture
of Bst Polymerase and extremely thermostable reverse transcriptase (65°C
tolerant), which is suitable for the isothermal amplification reaction of RNA.
It can detect low-sensitivity RNA molecules. Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase is
suitable for isothermal amplification reaction of both DNA and RNA templates,
which can detect low-sensitivity nucleic acid templates with great efficiency
and specificity. Besides, with a special preparation process, this enzyme has
a fast amplification rate and high tolerance to impurity. Since Bst DNA/RNA
Polymerase is extremely thermostable and also provides sensitive reverse
transcriptase activity, it is reported to have higher sensitivity at high Ct
values. [1] Bst P DNA/RNA Polymerase: The most advanced enzyme solution Bst P
DNA/RNA Polymerase is an upgraded version of Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase through
enzyme electronic re-structure and evolution screening (in silico Design & in
vitro Evolution), which is generally used for LAMP or RT-LAMP amplification of
DNA or RNA. Performance improvements include: The whole Bst P DNA/RNA System
includes hot start Aptamer, which ensures that the enzyme activity blocking
efficiency is >95% at <30°C, and the enzyme activity is completely released
within 1 min at >60°C. This characteristic facilitates the establishment of
the reaction system at room temperature and greatly reduces the non-specific
amplification at low temperatures. The reaction temperature is further raised
to 70°C, which greatly reduces the formation of primer dimer, improves the
amplification specificity, and makes the nucleic acid release of crude samples
more sufficient. The whole portfolio contains Helicase, so Premium LAMP
amplification (pLAMP) is allowed without using F3/B3 primers. At the same
time, Helicase has the function of assisting in strand unwinding, which
further reduces the concentration of FIP/BIP primers. This will further reduce
non-specific amplification and greatly improve amplification homogeneity.
Comparison between the most common Bst DNA Polymerase and the latest Bst P
DNA/RNA Polymerase In conclusion, the selection of a Bst polymerase variant
hinges on your research objectives, with each offering distinct capabilities
and benefits. We trust this comprehensive overview will guide you in selecting
an enzyme that seamlessly aligns with your research pursuits. At SBS Genetech,
our diverse array of Bst polymerases is meticulously curated to meet your
varied requirements. Reference [1] Lu S, Duplat D, Benitez-Bolivar P, León C,

Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) with SBS Genetech's Bst P DNA/RNA
Polymerase December 15, 2023 · Isothermal Amp Loop-mediated isothermal
amplification of DNA is a powerful molecular biology technique used to amplify
specific DNA sequences under isothermal conditions. Unlike traditional
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which requires thermal cycling through
different temperature steps, LAMP amplifies DNA at a constant temperature,
typically between 60-65°C. The LAMP reaction relies on a strand-displacing DNA
polymerase, usually Bst DNA polymerase, and a set of four to six primers that
recognize multiple regions within the target DNA sequence. These primers
initiate DNA synthesis in a cyclic manner, leading to the formation of stem-
loop DNA structures known as amplicons. These structures serve as templates
for further amplification, resulting in exponential accumulation of DNA. Key
features of LAMP include: Isothermal amplification : The reaction is conducted
at a constant temperature, eliminating the need for a thermal cycler and
simplifying the amplification process. High specificity : LAMP employs
multiple primers that recognize different regions of the target sequence,
enhancing specificity and reducing the likelihood of nonspecific
amplification. Efficiency : LAMP is highly efficient and can amplify target
DNA rapidly, typically within 30-60 minutes. Visual detection : The
amplification products can often be detected visually by the naked eye through
turbidity caused by magnesium pyrophosphate precipitation or by the addition
of DNA intercalating dyes that produce a color change. Robustness : LAMP is
less sensitive to inhibitors present in crude samples compared to PCR, making
it suitable for direct amplification from complex biological samples such as
blood, urine, or saliva. LAMP has found widespread applications in various
fields including clinical diagnostics, food safety testing, environmental
monitoring, and point-of-care diagnostics due to its simplicity, rapidity, and
versatility. At SBS Genetech , our pioneering spirit drives us to continually
enhance our offerings in l oop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)

Molecular Diagnostics with SBS Genetech's RPA Multiplex Fluorescent
Lyophilized Kit (Gen-4) February 29, 2024 · Isothermal Amp In the realm of
molecular biology, the quest for efficient and precise nucleic acid
amplification techniques has been a driving force behind numerous
groundbreaking innovations. Among these, Recombinase Polymerase Amplification
(RPA) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) stand out as two formidable
methodologies, each with its unique strengths and applications. Principle:
PCR: PCR involves repeated cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension
using a thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme. RPA: RPA is an isothermal
amplification technique that uses recombinase proteins to facilitate primer
binding and strand displacement, followed by polymerase-mediated DNA
synthesis. Temperature Requirements: PCR: Requires cycling through different
temperature stages (denaturation, annealing, extension) typically ranging from
50°C to 95°C. RPA: Operates at a constant, lower temperature (usually around
37-42°C), eliminating the need for thermal cycling equipment. Speed: PCR:
Generally takes around 1-2 hours due to cycling through multiple temperature
stages. RPA: Typically faster than PCR, with reaction times ranging from 10 to
60 minutes, making it advantageous for rapid diagnostics. Sensitivity: PCR:
Highly sensitive and capable of detecting low concentrations of DNA. RPA: Also
highly sensitive and capable of detecting low copy numbers of target DNA,
comparable to PCR. Equipment: PCR: Requires a thermal cycler to control
temperature cycles. RPA: Does not require a thermal cycler, making it more
accessible, especially for point-of-care testing or field applications.
Applications: PCR: Widely used in research, clinical diagnostics, forensics,
and molecular biology applications. RPA: Also applicable in diagnostics,
particularly in resource-limited settings or fieldwork due to its rapid and
equipment-independent nature. It's also gaining popularity in environmental
monitoring and food safety testing. Ease of Use: PCR: Requires precise
temperature control and cycling conditions, often necessitating trained
personnel and specialized equipment. RPA: Simplified protocol and isothermal
conditions make it more user-friendly, potentially enabling use by non-
specialists in various settings. As a summary, RPA, a relatively recent
addition to the molecular biologist's toolkit, has rapidly gained prominence
due to its isothermal nature and rapid amplification capabilities. Unlike PCR,
which relies on thermal cycling to denature, anneal, and extend DNA strands,
RPA operates at a constant temperature, typically around 37-42°C. This feature
eliminates the need for sophisticated thermal cycling equipment, making RPA
particularly attractive for point-of-care testing (POCT) and field
applications where resources may be limited. Furthermore, RPA's reliance on
recombinase proteins to facilitate primer binding and strand displacement,
followed by polymerase-mediated DNA synthesis, enables swift amplification of
target sequences. The simplicity of the protocol and the speed of the
reaction, typically completing within 10 to 20 minutes, make RPA an invaluable
tool in scenarios requiring rapid diagnostics and screening. Despite these
advantages, PCR remains the gold standard in many molecular biology
laboratories due to its well-established protocols, high sensitivity, and
versatility. However, RPA's emergence has undoubtedly expanded the landscape
of nucleic acid amplification techniques, offering novel solutions to old
challenges. Introducing the RPA Multiplex Fluorescent Lyophilized Kit (Gen-4)

particularly with the advancement of Real-time Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
technology, nucleic acid amplification techniques have permeated various
fields of biological science. Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) ,
developed by the UK-based company TwistDx Inc in 2006, has emerged as a
rapidly evolving isothermal amplification technology in recent years. It
offers advantages such as rapidity, sensitivity, good specificity, and
suitability for on-site rapid detection, and has been applied in multiple
fields including transgenic organisms, various pathogens, and food safety
testing. In the field of transgenic organisms, RPA technology enables
researchers to quickly and accurately detect and identify transgenic
sequences, providing effective technical support for related research. In
pathogen detection, the high specificity and sensitivity of RPA technology
make it an ideal choice for rapid pathogen detection, particularly playing a
significant role in clinical diagnosis and epidemic monitoring. Additionally,
RPA technology is widely utilized in the field of food safety, where it can be
employed for the rapid detection of potential contaminants or pathogenic
microorganisms in food, ensuring food safety and public health. Basics of RPA
The RPA reaction primarily relies on the recombinase UvsX and the recombinase
loading factor UvsY (auxiliary protein) derived from the T4 bacteriophage,
along with the Single-Stranded DNA-Binding Protein (SSB) Gp32, and the strand-
displacing DNA polymerase Bsu (Bacillus subtilis Pol) or Sau (Staphylococcus
aureus Pol). The amplification of the template is achieved based on the T4
bacteriophage's nucleic acid replication mechanism. Initially, in the presence
of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the primer forms a nucleoprotein filament
complex with the recombinase UvsX. This complex bi-directionally scans the
target double-stranded DNA for homologous sequences. Once a homologous
sequence is found, the recombinase dissociates the double-stranded DNA at this
position, forming a D-loop structure. One side of the D-loop remains double-
stranded, undergoing strand displacement, while the other side becomes single-
stranded, stabilized by the SSB protein Gp32. Subsequently, the nucleoprotein
filament complex actively hydrolyzes ATP, causing a conformational change and
exposing the 3' end of the primer. At this point, the DNA polymerase Bsu binds
to the 3' end of the primer, initiating the DNA amplification reaction and
forming a new complementary strand. In this reaction, the processes mediated
by forward and reverse primers occur simultaneously. The newly formed single
strand pairs with the original strand, generating a complete amplicon. This
amplification process repeats continuously, leading to exponential growth of
the amplification product. The entire process is typically completed within 20
minutes. During the reaction, competition exists between the SSB protein and
UvsX for primer binding sites. The auxiliary protein UvsY can invade the
primer-covered binding sites of the SSB protein, preventing the recombination
phenomenon that occurs when the SSB protein binds to the primer, and it can
facilitate the binding of UvsX to the primer, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Schematic Diagram of Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA)
Types of RPA Detection Methods Basic RPA Detection Basic RPA detection is a
nucleic acid detection method that combines RPA technology with agarose gel
electrophoresis. The main detection process involves performing RPA
amplification reaction under constant temperature conditions (37-39°C) for
20-40 minutes. After the reaction is completed, agarose gel electrophoresis is
used to detect the RPA amplification products. Components such as recombinase
and single-stranded binding protein in the RPA reaction system can bind to the
amplification products, inhibiting their migration in the gel. This can lead
to smear patterns in gel electrophoresis results. To avoid this, phenol and
chloroform are added to the amplification products in a 1:1 volume ratio. The
products are then extracted, and the extracted amplification products are
subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. Similar to the gel electrophoresis
process for PCR products, RPA amplification products are mixed with nucleic
acid dyes like EB before gel electrophoresis. The presence or absence of bands
and their sizes on the gel determine the detection results of the target
nucleic acid. Recombinase Polymerase Amplification with Lateral Flow Dipstick
(RPA-LFD) RPA-LFD is a nucleic acid detection method that combines RPA
technology with lateral flow dipstick (LFD). In comparison to the basic RPA
detection method, the RPA-LFD reaction system includes a DNA endonuclease
(nfo), an nfo probe, and a downstream primer labeled with biotin. The nfo
probe is approximately 50 nt long, with a FAM fluorescent group at the 5' end,
a blocking group (typically C3spacer) at the 3' end, and a tetrahydrofuran
(THF) molecule in the middle, as shown in Figure 2. The DNA endonuclease nfo
recognizes the THF molecule in the nfo probe and cleaves it. After cleavage,
the probe produces a free hydroxyl end, acting as an upstream primer. This new
upstream primer, along with the biotin-labeled downstream primer, undergoes
amplification to yield an amplification product with a FAM group at the 5' end
and biotin at the 3' end. This amplification product can be detected using a
lateral flow dipstick. Figure 2: Schematic Diagram of the Structure of the nfo
Probe LFD, based on lateral flow chromatography, immunology, and colloidal
gold technologies, is a type of test strip. The strip is mainly composed of
three parts: the sample pad, detection line, and control line. The sample pad
contains colloidal gold particles labeled with anti-FAM antibodies, the
detection line has a ligand with biotin, and the control line has another
antibody that can bind to anti-FAM antibodies. The specific detection
principle of LFD is illustrated in Figure 3. Firstly, the FAM groups on the
amplification product bind to the anti-FAM antibodies on the sample pad,
forming an immune complex. Then, all colloidal gold particles migrate to the
detection line under the action of the buffer solution. When they reach the
detection line, the biotin on the amplification product is captured by the
biotin ligand on the detection line, causing the amplification product to
aggregate. This aggregation results in the appearance of a red band on the
detection line. Colloidal gold particles that fail to bind to the
amplification product continue to migrate beyond the detection line. When they
reach the control line, the anti-FAM antibodies on the colloidal gold
particles bind to the antibodies on the control line, leading to the
aggregation of colloidal gold particles and the appearance of a red band on
the control line. The presence of a red band on the control line indicates the
completion of LFD detection. Therefore, when the test result is positive, two
red bands can be observed on the LFD – one on the detection line and one on
the control line. When the result is negative, only a red band on the control
line is visible on the LFD. Currently, LFD can be combined with various
nucleic acid amplification technologies such as LAMP, RCA, and RPA for the
detection of target nucleic acids. The advantage of RPA-LFD lies in its simple
operation, absence of complex instruments, and the ability to directly observe
the detection results with the naked eye, making it suitable for on-site rapid
testing. Figure 3: Schematic Diagram of LFD Detection Principle Real-time
Fluorescent RPA Detection The real-time fluorescent RPA detection method is a
nucleic acid detection approach that combines RPA technology with real-time
fluorescent detection technology. In comparison to the basic RPA detection
method's reaction system, the real-time fluorescent RPA reaction system
incorporates the nucleic acid endonuclease exo and exo probes. The exo probe
is a probe with a size of 46-52 nt, featuring a pair of thymine bases, each
carrying a fluorescent group and a quenching group. These thymine bases are
separated by a THF spacer, and the 3' end of the probe is connected to a
blocking group. The specific structure of the probe is illustrated in Figure
4. The fluorescent group in the probe is generally FAM, the quenching group is
typically BHQ, and the blocking group is commonly C3spacer. The nucleic acid
endonuclease exo can recognize THF molecules in the exo probe and, after
hybridization of the exo probe with the amplification product, cleave the THF
molecule. This cleavage separates the fluorescent and quenching groups in the
probe, leading to the generation of fluorescence. Equipment capable of real-
time monitoring of fluorescent signals can be used to detect the fluorescence
intensity during the reaction process, allowing for the determination of the
detection results for the target nucleic acid. Figure 4: Schematic Diagram of
the Structure of the exo Probe Currently, real-time fluorescent RPA detection
methods have found widespread application in pathogen detection, food safety,
and other fields. In comparison to basic RPA detection methods and RPA-LFD
methods, the real-time fluorescent RPA detection method offers notable
advantages with a shorter detection time, completing within 20 minutes.
Additionally, it exhibits high specificity and sensitivity. Figure 5:

labor-intensive, and susceptible to contamination. RPA technology has shown
significant advantages in bacterial detection. For instance, E. coli, a normal
flora in the human intestinal tract, can cause severe enteritis and diarrhea
when consumed through contaminated food. Liu Jingwen and others utilized RT-
RPA with exo probes at 37°C to qualitatively detect E. coli within 20 minutes,
achieving a significantly shorter detection time compared to traditional
methods. The method also demonstrated a low detection limit of 0.01ng/μl,
providing technical support for rapid clinical diagnosis. Wang et al.
developed a dual-detection biosensor based on RPA and a three-stage lateral
flow strip. The biosensor performed dual-chain RPA reactions for Vibrio

mild reaction conditions. This method is suitable for on-site inspections in
remote areas, contributing to global progress in malaria prevention and
control. Guo Qinghong developed an RPA-LFD detection method for diagnosing
Japanese schistosomiasis in mice and sheep using the G01 fragment. The method
exhibited high sensitivity (97.22% for mice, 93.75% for sheep) and 100%
specificity for negative samples, showing no cross-reactivity with other
flukes. The results indicate that the RPA-LFD method has high specificity and
sensitivity for detecting Japanese schistosomiasis. 4\. Food Safety Detection
RPA technology is widely applied in food safety detection. Choi established a
detection method for Vibrio parahaemolyticus using RPA, achieving detection
within 20 minutes. Tang developed a real-time fluorescent RPA detection method
for Vibrio cholerae, capable of detecting 5 copies of bacterial DNA within 20
minutes. Additionally, RPA technology is utilized for the screening and

Return to site What is Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification for Detection of
Nucleic Acids? Explore how Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) with
Bst Polymerase has revolutionized nucleic acid detection November 25, 2023 ·
Isothermal Amp In the realm of molecular biology, the quest for efficient,
rapid, and sensitive techniques for detecting nucleic acids has been ongoing.
One such groundbreaking method that has emerged in recent years is Loop-
Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP). This innovative technique has
revolutionized nucleic acid detection by offering a robust, rapid, and cost-
effective alternative to traditional PCR-based methods. Principles of LAMP
Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification operates on a simple yet ingenious
principle, allowing the amplification of DNA (and sometimes RNA) under
isothermal conditions. Unlike conventional PCR, which necessitates thermal
cycling, LAMP achieves amplification at a constant temperature, typically
around 60-65°C. This is made possible through the use of a DNA polymerase
enzyme with strand displacement activity, which facilitates continuous DNA
synthesis without the need for thermal cycling. The key player in this process
is Bst (Bacillus stearothermophilus) DNA polymerase, a thermostable enzyme
with robust strand displacement activity. Bst polymerase efficiently
synthesizes DNA strands while displacing the existing strands, enabling the
continuous amplification of target DNA sequences. This unique enzymatic
property allows LAMP to proceed rapidly and efficiently under isothermal
conditions. The process begins with the design of four to six primers that
target multiple regions of the DNA sequence of interest. These primers
initiate the amplification process by binding to their specific target
sequences on the DNA template. As the DNA polymerase extends the primers, it
displaces the existing DNA strands, creating single-stranded regions for
further primer binding and extension. This results in the formation of a
unique stem-loop structure with multiple repeats of the target sequence. The
reaction proceeds in a cyclical manner, with each cycle generating an
exponentially increasing amount of DNA. Applications and Advantages The
versatility and utility of Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification are
reflected in its broad range of applications. From molecular diagnostics to
pathogen detection and genetic analysis, LAMP has found use in various fields
including medicine, veterinary science, agriculture, and environmental
monitoring. One of the most significant advantages of LAMP is its high
specificity and sensitivity, which rivals that of traditional PCR methods.
Additionally, LAMP offers rapid amplification under isothermal conditions,
eliminating the need for expensive thermal cycling equipment and reducing
assay time. Furthermore, LAMP assays can be performed using simple
instrumentation, making them accessible even in resource-limited settings.
Detection Methods The amplified DNA generated by LAMP can be detected using
various methods depending on the specific application. Turbidity measurements,
based on the accumulation of magnesium pyrophosphate during the reaction,
offer a simple and cost-effective detection method. Colorimetric indicators,
such as pH-sensitive dyes, provide a visual readout of amplification through
color changes in the reaction tube. Fluorescence-based assays offer high
sensitivity and quantitative analysis capabilities, making them ideal for
research and diagnostic applications. Visual inspection of color changes in
reaction tubes can also serve as a low-cost and straightforward detection
method, particularly in field settings. Case Study The paper titled " Portable
Real-Time Colorimetric LAMP-Device for Rapid Quantitative Detection of Nucleic
Acids in Crude Samples ," published in Scientific Reports, highlights a
significant breakthrough in molecular diagnostics. This collaborative effort
between the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology and BIOPIX DNA
TECHNOLOGY PC marks a milestone in the development of a portable real-time
colorimetric LAMP device. This innovative technology promises to revolutionize
disease diagnostics, particularly in resource-limited settings. The portable
real-time colorimetric LAMP device represents a fusion of accuracy from lab-
based quantitative analysis and the simplicity of point-of-care testing. Its
design incorporates a plastic tube anchored vertically on a hot surface, with
side walls exposed to a mini camera capable of capturing real-time color
changes during LAMP amplification. This setup enables rapid analysis,
quantification over a wide dynamic range, and compatibility with crude samples
like saliva, tissue, and swabs. Distinguishing itself from conventional
diagnostic platforms, the device offers numerous competitive features. These
include rapid analysis time, quantification of nucleic acids over nine log-
units, compatibility with crude samples, low detection limit (< 5
copies/reaction), smartphone operation, and rapid prototyping through 3D
printing. Additionally, users have the flexibility to select the dye of
interest, such as Phenol red or Hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB), enhancing its
versatility and practicality. Central to the functionality of this device is
the integration of SBS Genetech's Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase within the LAMP
assay. Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase represents a fusion of Bst Polymerase and an
exceptionally thermostable reverse transcriptase (tolerant up to 65°C), making
it ideal for the isothermal amplification of both DNA and RNA templates. This
unique composition enables the detection of low-sensitivity RNA molecules,
rendering it highly recommended for isothermal amplification experiments
utilizing RNA as a template. The robust amplification capability of Bst
DNA/RNA Polymerase, coupled with the real-time colorimetric detection method,
ensures remarkable sensitivity, specificity, and tolerance to inhibitory
substances. This combination empowers the device with the capability to cater
to a wide range of diagnostic applications, promising accurate and reliable
results even in challenging conditions. Beyond Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase At SBS

Return to site Is Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification LAMP a Rapid Accurate
and Cost Effective Diagnostic Method for Infectious Diseases? Discover how
Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) is transforming infectious
disease diagnosis October 30, 2023 · Isothermal Amp Infectious diseases pose
significant challenges to global public health, necessitating the development
of rapid, accurate, and cost-effective diagnostic methods for effective
disease management and control. Among the various diagnostic techniques
available, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has emerged as a
game-changer in the field of infectious disease diagnosis. This article delves
into the key characteristics and applications of LAMP, highlighting its
importance and potential impact on healthcare systems worldwide. Rapid
Detection One of the most compelling features of LAMP is its rapid detection
capability. Unlike polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which requires complex
temperature cycling, LAMP operates under isothermal conditions, meaning it can
amplify target DNA sequences quickly and efficiently within a single reaction
at a constant temperature. This feature allows for the detection of infectious
agents within minutes to an hour, significantly reducing turnaround time
compared to traditional methods. Accuracy and Specificity Accuracy is
paramount in diagnostic testing, and LAMP excels in this aspect. By utilizing
multiple primers targeting distinct regions of the target DNA, LAMP achieves
high specificity, minimizing the risk of false-positive results. The
technique's robustness in differentiating between closely related DNA
sequences enhances its reliability in identifying infectious pathogens
accurately. Cost-Effectiveness In resource-limited settings where
sophisticated laboratory infrastructure may be lacking, cost-effective
diagnostic methods are crucial. LAMP addresses this need admirably. The
simplicity of LAMP assays and the minimal equipment requirements make it an
attractive option for low-resource settings. Moreover, the elimination of the
need for expensive thermal cyclers, coupled with the ability to visualize
results using basic colorimetric indicators, significantly reduces the overall
cost of testing. Ease of Use and Implementation Another advantage of LAMP is
its ease of use and implementation. The technique is relatively
straightforward and can be performed by trained technicians with minimal
hands-on time. Its adaptability to various sample types, including blood,
saliva, and swabs, further enhances its utility in diverse clinical settings.
Additionally, LAMP assays can be deployed at point-of-care facilities,
allowing for decentralized testing and timely diagnosis, which is particularly
crucial during disease outbreaks and emergencies. Versatility LAMP's
versatility in detecting a wide range of infectious agents underscores its
significance in disease diagnosis. From bacterial infections such as
tuberculosis and Streptococcus pneumoniae to viral pathogens like HIV and
hepatitis viruses, LAMP has demonstrated its efficacy across different disease
contexts. Furthermore, its applicability to parasites and fungi expands its
utility in diagnosing malaria, leishmaniasis, and fungal infections. Case
Study The paper titled " Portable Real-Time Colorimetric LAMP-Device for Rapid
Quantitative Detection of Nucleic Acids in Crude Samples ," published in
Scientific Reports, highlights a significant breakthrough in molecular
diagnostics. This collaborative effort between the Institute of Molecular
Biology and Biotechnology and BIOPIX DNA TECHNOLOGY PC marks a milestone in
the development of a portable real-time colorimetric LAMP device. This

Hazardous Materials (IF: 14)! This study enriched the diversity of plastic-
degrading microorganisms and is the first report on marine PS plastic-
degrading microorganisms. February 9, 2023 · Publications, News Recently, the
Marine Microbial Innovation Team of Third Institute of Oceanography, Ministry
of Natural Resources of China, published a research paper titled "
Biodegradation of polystyrene (PS) by marine bacteria in mangrove environment
" in the Journal of Hazardous Materials (impact factor: 14.224). This study
enriched the diversity of plastic-degrading microorganisms and is the first
report on marine PS plastic-degrading microorganisms. Polystyrene (PS) is one
of the most common plastic pollutants in marine environments. Its
microplastics are widely distributed in nearshore, deep-sea environments, and
marine organisms. Plastic pollution poses a serious threat to marine
ecosystems, and the fate of plastics in marine environments is an important
scientific issue of international concern. However, there is currently a lack
of understanding of the diversity of plastic-degrading microorganisms and
their environmental roles in marine environments, both domestically and
internationally. In order to obtain microbial resources for plastic
degradation in marine environments and evaluate their role in self-
purification of marine environments, the innovative team has conducted
systematic studies on plastic microorganisms in various marine environments,
such as deep sea and nearshore, in recent years, and has discovered and
obtained various microorganisms capable of degrading plastics, and conducted
research on their metabolic mechanisms. In this study, through field sampling
and laboratory analysis of foamed PS (Expanded PS, EPS) waste in mangrove
environments, multiple PS-degrading bacterial communities were obtained,
demonstrating that PS can be used as the sole carbon and energy source by
various marine degraders. Biofilms were formed on the surface of PS, and it
was found that bacteria from seven families, including Sphingomonadaceae ,
Rhodanobacteraceae , Rhizobiaceae , Dermacoccaceae , Rhodocyclaceae ,
Hyphomicrobiaceae , and Methyloligellaceae , were involved in PS degradation.
To further verify their degradation activity, nine genera of degrading
bacteria were isolated from the samples, including Novsphingobium, Gordonia,
Stappia, Mesobacillus, Alcanivorax, Flexivirga, Cytobacillus, Thioclava, and
Thalassospira. Degradation activity assays were conducted on two strains of
Novsphingobium and Gordonia, and degradation rates of 2.66% and 7.73% were
observed within 30 days, respectively. Metabolite analysis indicated that the
microbial degradation of PS occurred through an oxidation pathway. The
research results provide reference for further understanding the environmental
roles of marine plastic-degrading microorganisms and the development and
utilization of microbial resources for plastic degradation.

Plant (IF: 22)! The research discovered a regulatory pathway that activates
NADPH oxidase in ABA signal transduction and connects it to the core pathway
of ABA signal transduction, which could aid in developing crops that are more
resilient to environmental stress. · News, Publications On April 6th, a
research paper entitled " Phosphorylation of OsRbohB by the CaM-dependent
protein kinase OsDMI3 promotes H2O2 production to potentiate ABA responses in
rice " was published in the prestigious academic journal Molecular Plant
(impact factor: 21.949) by Professor Jiang Mingyi's research group from the
College of Life Sciences at Nanjing Agricultural University, the National Key
Laboratory of Crop Genetic and Germplasm Innovation and Utilization, and the
Key Laboratory of Crop Physiology, Ecology, and Production Management of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. The study highlights the
significance of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK), which
plays a critical role in the signal transduction of the plant hormone abscisic
acid (ABA) and abiotic stress. In particular, the CCaMK OsDMI3 in rice has
been shown to be a positive regulator of ABA responses, enhancing crop
tolerance to drought, salt, and oxidative stress. H2O2 is essential for ABA-
induced activation of OsDMI3, as it can oxidize and inactivate the type 2C
protein phosphatase (PP2C) OsPP45, thereby relieving the inhibition of OsDMI3
by OsPP45. The study discovered that ABA induces biphasic H2O2 bursts, and
both NADPH oxidases OsRbohB and OsRbohE are involved, with OsRbohB playing a
major role, and OsDMI3 only regulating the second-phase extracellular H2O2
burst induced by ABA. It was also demonstrated that OsRbohB is crucial for
important physiological processes regulated by ABA, such as seed germination,
root growth, stomatal movement, and rice tolerance to water and oxidative
stress. Furthermore, the study found that OsDMI3 can directly interact with
OsRbohB and phosphorylate OsRbohB Ser-191, which positively regulates NADPH
oxidase activity and H2O2 production in the extracellular space. This enhances
rice sensitivity to ABA in seed germination and root growth, as well as rice
tolerance to water and oxidative stress. Additionally, the study identified
that the rice protein SAPK8/9/10 can regulate ABA-induced biphasic
extracellular H2O2 bursts and act upstream of the OsDMI3-OsRbohB pathway in
ABA signal transduction. Overall, this research not only uncovers an important
regulatory pathway that directly regulates the activation of NADPH oxidase in
ABA signal transduction, but also connects this regulatory pathway to the core
pathway of ABA signal transduction. This knowledge could be useful for
developing crops that are more resilient to environmental stress, such as
drought and oxidative stress. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2023.04.003 In
this research study, the Muta-direct™ Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, developed
by SBS Genetech, was employed. As a company, SBS Genetech is dedicated to
