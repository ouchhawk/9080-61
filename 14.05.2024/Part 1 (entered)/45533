A New Discovery in Every Chip At INITIO CELL, we develop patented multi-functional organ-on-a-chip devices and assays for drug discovery and diagnostics . PRECISION MEDICINE Classical drug discovery uses 2D cell culture coupled with animal testing for preclinical studies. Neither 2D cell culture nor animal testing truly recapitulate the in vivo micro environments of cells in a human body. The paradigm shift is to use 3D cell culture in organ-on-a-chip devices that can faithfully mimic the in vivo conditions. Using organ-on-a-chip technology is expected to reduce R&D costs (186 B $ in 2020) by 26%. Distance Dependent Interaction DDI-Chip The DDI-Chip investigates the interactions between cells and cells and/or factors at different distances from each other in a physiological setup and allows simultaneous investigation of different distances in the same device.

SEMA6D Di ﬀerentially Regulates Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion of Breast Cell Lines Zehra Elif Gunyuz, Ece Sahi-Ilhan, Cansu Kucukkose, Dogac Ipekgil, Gunes Tok, Gulistan Mese, Engin Ozcivici, and Ozden Yalcin-Ozuysal * Cite This: ACS Omega 2022, 7, 15769 −15778 Read Online ACCESS Metrics & More Article Recommendations *sıSupporting Information ABSTRACT: Semaphorin 6D (SEMA6D), a member of the class 6 semaphorin family, is a membrane-associated protein that plays akey role in the development of cardiac and neural tissues. A growingbody of evidence suggests that SEMA6D is also involved intumorigenesis. In breast cancer, high SEMA6D levels are correlatedwith better survival rates. However, very little is known about thefunctional signi ﬁcance of SEMA6D in breast tumorigenesis. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the e ﬀects of SEMA6D expression on the normal breast cell line MCF10A and the breastcancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA MB 231. We demonstrated thatSEMA6D expression increases the proliferation of MCF10A cells,whereas the opposite e ﬀect was observed in MCF7 cells. SEMA6D expression induced anchorage-independent growth in both cancercell lines. Furthermore, migration of MCF10A and MCF7 cells and invasion of MDA MB 231 cells were elevated in response toSEMA6D overexpression. Accordingly, the genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were altered by SEMA6Dexpression in MCF10A and MCF7 cell lines. Finally, we provided evidence that SEMA6D levels were associated with the expressionof the cell cycle, EMT, and Notch signaling pathway-related genes in breast cancer patients ’data. We showed for the ﬁrst time that SEMA6D overexpression has cell-speci ﬁceﬀects on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of normal and cancer breast cell lines, which agrees with the gene expression data of clinical samples. This study lays the groundwork for future research into understanding the functional importance of SEMA6D in breast cancer. ■INTRODUCTION Semaphorin 6D (SEMA6D) belongs to class 6 of semaphorins, which constitute a large family of secreted and membrane-bound proteins. Semaphor ins were initially identi ﬁed as regulators of axon guidance during the development of thenervous system by providing repellent or attractant cues. Furtherstudies revealed that semaphorin family members are involved intissue homeostasis as well as tumorigenesis through the regulation of cell proliferation, cell survival, cell adhesion and migration, immune response regulation, and angiogenesis. 1 SEMA6D research extensively focused on developmental aspects highlighting its role in axonal extension, cardiacdevelopment, neural tube closure, anti-in ﬂammatory macro- phage polarization, oligodendrocyte positioning, and crossing ofretinal ganglion cells. 2−8Beyond its function in developmental processes, accumulating evidence suggests that SEMA6D also plays a part in tumorigenesis. In osteosarcoma, SEMA6D was identi ﬁed as a candidate oncogene through transposon muta- genesis screening. The functional analysis supported theoncogenic potential of SEMA6D in osteosarcoma, where itsoverexpression increased soft agar colony formation, cellproliferation, and in vivo tumor formation through ERKphosphorylation. 9More recent research also presented evidence for an active role of SEMA6D in the cisplatin resistancemechanism in osteosarcoma. 10Likewise, SEMA6D showed an oncogenic behavior in mesothelioma by protecting the cellsfrom apoptosis and increasing soft agar colony formation. 11 Supporting these ﬁndings, in gastric and esophageal cancers, SEMA6D expression was found to be increased in tumorscompared to normal tissues. 12On the other hand, in lung adenocarcinoma, SEMA6D expression was downregulated, andlower SEMA6D levels were associated with shorter overallsurvival indicating a tumor suppressor role in the lung. 13 Altogether, the data suggest a context-dependent role forSEMA6D in tumorigenesis. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer type and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. 14To Received: February 10, 2022 Accepted: April 14, 2022 Published: April 27, 2022 Article http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf © 2022 The Authors.

In this context, the role of SEMA6D inbreast tumorigenesis remains largely unexplored. What we knowis based on the two previous studies that examined breast cancerpatient samples. 15,16The ﬁrst study analyzed SEMA6D expression in 1100 samples through The Cancer GenomeAtlas (TCGA) database and reported that a high SEMA6Dexpression is correlated with better survival, which is moresigniﬁcantly pronounced in the triple-negative subgroup. 15 More recently, single nucleotide variations in SEMA6D were reported in two of the 37 young patients with early onset luminalbreast cancer.16Moreover, in line with the previous data, overall survival and relapse-free survival rates were better in the patientgroup with a higher SEMA6D expression.16Research to date has not yet thoroughly determined the functional signi ﬁcance of SEMA6D expression in breast cancer. Here, we aimed to analyze cellular and molecular changes in response to SEMA6D overexpression in normal breast andbreast cancer cell lines. We showed that although SEMA6Doverexpression induced a pro-tumorigenic phenotype in thenormal cell line, it negatively a ﬀected tumorigenic traits of the cancer cell lines while promoting a more migratory andmesenchymal phenotype in both normal and cancer cell lines.The experimental work we present here provides the ﬁrst evidence showing that SEMA6D has cell-speci ﬁceﬀects in breast cancer, which might re ﬂect on the di ﬀerent clinical outcomes in diﬀerent breast cancer patient groups. ■MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Lines and Viral Infections. MCF10A, MCF7, MDA MB 231, and HEK293T cells were obtained from AmericanType Culture Collection, ATCC. MCF10A cells were culturedin high glucose DMEM-F12 (Gibco, 31330-038) supplementedwith 5% horse serum (Gibco, 16050 −122), 1% penicillin/ streptomycin (Thermo-Fisher Scienti ﬁc, 15140-122), 20 ng/mg EGF (Sigma, E9644), 0.5 μg/mg hydrocortisone (Sigma, H0888), 100 ng/mL choleratoxin (Sigma, C8052), and 10μg/mg insulin (Sigma, I1882). MDA MB 231, MCF7, and HEK293T cell lines were maintained in high glucose DMEM(Gibco, 41966-029) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum(FBS) (Gibco, 10270106) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin(Gibco, 15140-122). All cell lines were maintained in ahumidi ﬁed incubator with 5% CO 2at 37 °C. Overexpression of SEMA6D was performed by a lentiviral expression system.Viruses were prepared, and infections were carried out asexplained previously. 17pLX304-SEMA6D plasmid was obtained from Dharmacon (OHS6085-213576758) (GenBank reference:BC150253). LacZ in pLX304 (pLX304-LacZ) was a gift fromWilliam Hahn (Addgene plasmid no. 42560). 18Stable cell lines were generated by 2 μg/mL blasticidin (Santa Cruz, sc- 204655A) selection. MCF10A cells that have increased Notchactivation upon overexpression of Notch1 intracellular domain(NICD) were described previously. 17 RNA Isolation and qRT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated using the Pure-link RNA mini kit (Invitrogen, 12183018A). cDNA was synthesized using the RevertAid ﬁrst-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scienti ﬁc, K1622). PCR ampli ﬁcation and detection were done on Roche LightCycler 96 Real-TimePCR Detection System using FastStart Essential DNA GreenMaster (Roche, 06402712001). TATA-box binding protein(TBP) was used as the internal control for normalization.Relative mRNA levels were calculated using delta −delta Ctmethod. Each experiment is normalized to its own control condition. At least three independent experiments were done.The primer pairs are listed in Table S1 . Protein Isolation and Western Blot Analysis. Total protein was extracted using RIPA lysis bu ﬀer. Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from 3.5 ×10 5MCF10A cells, 4 × 105MDA MB 231, and MCF7 cells seeded on a 6-well plate after 2 days of incubation with serum-free medium. Protein isolationfrom CM was done by methanol/chloroform precipitation asdescribed previously. 19The amount of protein was quanti ﬁed with Bradford Assay. The total amount of protein of 60 μg from cell lysates and 20 μg from CM were separated via SDS-gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes. After blocking with 5% skim milk, the membranes were incubated with the following antibodies: anti- β-actin (Abcam, ab75186, 1:2000), anti- N-cadherin (Cell Signaling Technology, 13116T, 1:1000), anti-SNAI2 (Cell Signaling Technology,9585S, 1:1000), anti-SEMA6D (total cell lysates) (Abcam,ab191169, 1:250), and anti-SEMA6D (CM) (R&D, AF2095-SP, 1:1000). Following secondary antibody incubation, thedetection was done using Vilber Fusion SL Imaging System. MTT Assay. 6×10 4cells/well were seeded on a 24-well plate. Cells were treated with methylthiazolyldiphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) (Amresco, 0793) for 4 h on the second,fourth, sixth, and eighth days after plating. Following theaddition of DMSO as the solvent, absorbance was read at 570and 650 nm by using Thermo Multiskan Spectrum. Immuno ﬂuorescence and BrdU Assay. 2.5×10 5 MCF10A and 3.5 ×105MDA MB 231 and MCF7 cells/well were grown on coverslips on a 6-well plate for 48 h. For the BrdUassay, cells were incubated with 20 μM bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 4 h. Cells were gently washed with PBS 1X and ﬁxed with 1 mL of 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS 1X for 20 minat room temperature. Then the cells were permeabilized with0.1% TritonX-100/PBS for 15 min and blocked with 5% BSA in0.1% TritonX-100/PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Anti-BrdU (Cell Signaling Technology, 5292, 1:200) for BrdU, anti-V5 (CST, mAB13202, 1:1000) for V5 tag, and DAPI (Sigma, D9542, 1:500) for nucleus staining were used. Afterward, the cells were rinsed with PBS 1X (3 times, 10 min each) andmounted on Ibidi Mounting Medium (IMM, Cat. 50001).Fluorescent images were captured by using Olympus IX83ﬂuorescent microscope. Soft Agar Colony Formation Assay. 3×10 4cells were mixed with 0.35% noble agar (BD Difco Noble Agar, 12185 − 010) and seeded on top of solidi ﬁed 0.5% noble agar on 6-well plates. The complete medium was added after the solidi ﬁcation of the top layer, and the medium was changed twice a week for 6weeks. After staining colonies with 0.05% crystal violet, theimages focused on three di ﬀerent Z layers were captured for each well under a Leica DMI8 confocal microscope. The sizes ofcolonies that are higher than 30 μM in diameter were counted using ImageJ. Total colony numbers were normalized to thecontrol condition in each of three independent experiments. Wound Healing Assay. 7.5×10 5cells/well were seeded on a 12-well plate. The following day, cells were incubated with 10μg/mL Mitomycin C (Santa Cruz, sc-3514A) for 2 h. Then the scratch was introduced with a 10 μL pipet tip, and 1% serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin-containing medium were added.The gaps were monitored at 37 °C with 5% CO 2under a Leica DMI8 confocal microscope supplemented with the incubationchamber. Open area percentages were calculated for eachposition in three independent experiments.ACS Omega http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf Article https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c00840 ACS Omega 2022, 7, 15769 −1577815770Invasion Assay. Three-channel lab-on-a-chip system (Initio) was used for invasion analysis, as explained previously.17 Brieﬂy, cells were labeled transiently with a green ﬂuorescent dye using Green Cell Tracker CMFDA (C2925, Invitrogen). The stock solution of Green Cell Tracker (25 mM) was diluted inserum-free DMEM to 5 μMﬁnal concentration. Following incubation with 5 μM CMFDA dye at 37 °C for 30 min, cellswere washed with PBS and supplemented with the culture medium until loading. Then the growth factor reduced Matrigel(Corning, 356230) was mixed with the serum-free medium in a 1:1 ratio and loaded into the middle channel. After polymer- ization, 20% serum-containing medium was loaded to the lowerchannel, and labeled cells at the concentration of 1 ×10 6cells/ ml in serum-free medium were loaded to the upper channel.

Quanti ﬁcation was done as previously explained.17 Data Mining Studies. UCSC Xena ( http://xena.ucsc.edu/ ) was used to analyze mRNA expression of the SEMA6D gene in addition to cell cycle-related genes, epithelial-mesenchymaltransition (EMT) genes, and Notch pathway genes ( Table S2 )using the TCGA database ( https://www.cancer.gov/tcga ) for breast-invasive carcinoma (1247 patients). 20The entire population was strati ﬁed based on SEMA6D mRNA expression quartiles, and the highest (0 −25th %) Sema6D expressing samples were labeled as Sema6D-High and the lowest (75th % − 100th %) Sema6D expressing samples were labeled as Sema6D- Low. Expression of the cell cycle, EMT, and Notch-related geneswere compared between Sema6D-Low and -High populations. Figure 2. SEMA6D increases migratory potential.

Data were analyzed for statistical signi ﬁcance by the Welch test ( ttest with unequal variances). Furthermore, cell cycle, EMT, and Notch-related genes were clustered based on uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) for dimension reduction (arXiv:1802.03426) using BioVinci software and presented with respect to SEMA6D expression with a scoring threshold of 0.4.Statistical Analysis. A two-tailed, unpaired (samples with equal variance) Student ’sttest method was used for statistical analysis unless stated otherwise. ■RESULTS SEMA6D Has Opposing E ﬀects on the Proliferation of Normal Breast Cell Line MCF10A and Breast Cancer CellLine MCF7. First, we generated stable cell lines that overexpress SEMA6D to investigate its role in breast cells. We used MCF7 Figure 3. SEMA6D promotes invasion of MDA MB 231 cells.

(B) Following thresholding of the Z-stack images, the distance of each bright pixel to starting line (vertical dashed line in A) was calculated and normalized to day 1 for each gate. All of the distance value s for nine gates from three independent experiments were plotted. (C) Mean and median distance values of three independent experiments were plotted. Each dot represents one gate ( *p< 0.05).ACS Omega http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf Article https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c00840 ACS Omega 2022, 7, 15769 −1577815773and MDA MB 231 as breast cancer cell lines, and MCF10A as a normal cell line. SEMA6D mRNA expression increased more than 600-fold in all cell lines compared to control cells, which stably expressed LacZ ( Figure S1A ). In accordance with previous results, a higher SEMA6D protein signal was detected in total cell lysates ( Figure 1 A, top panel). Protein levels were increased by 2.9- and 2.2-fold upon stable overexpression in MCF10A and MDA MB 231 cells, respectively ( Figure 1 B). Although we detected a 1.6-fold signi ﬁcant increase at the expected size range for MCF7 cells, because of the presence of several bands between LacZ and SEMA6D samples, we used an additional approach using the V5 tag at the C-terminal of the inserts for con ﬁrmation. Immuno ﬂuorescence assay showed that MCF7 cells that overexpress LacZ or SEMA6D are positive V5 signal ( Figure S1B ). Furthermore, we detected SEMA6D in the conditioned media of all the cells that overexpress SEMA6D (Figure 1 A, bottom panel), con ﬁrming proteolytic processing of the protein as observed previously in di ﬀerent tissues.5,8,11 Next, we analyzed whether SEMA6D overexpression a ﬀects the proliferation rate of the cells by BrdU incorporation assay. SEMA6D overexpression increased BrdU incorporation from 11.9% to 39.9% in MCF10A cells ( Figure 1 C). On the other hand, in MCF7 cells the ratio of BrdU positive cells was decreased from 41.2% to 31.6% in response to SEMA6D overexpression ( Figure 1 C). To assess whether the change in proliferation rate is re ﬂected in the growth pattern, we analyzed the growth curve of the cells by MTT assay. In parallel with the BrdU results, MCF10A cells that overexpress SEMA6D reachedhigher numbers earlier than the control cells that overexpress LacZ. Eight days after plating an equal number of cells, the number of total alive cells in MCF10A-SEMA6D and MCF10A- LacZ groups were increased by 20.5 and 16.5-fold, respectively(Figure S2 ). Consistent with the decrease in BrdU incorporation in response to SEMA6D overexpression, the number of alive cells in the MCF7-LacZ group was increased by 11.9-fold, which was reduced to 9.9-fold in MCF7-SEMA6D group ( Figure S2 ). In MDA MB 231 cells, SEMA6D overexpression did not changeeither the growth curve pattern or the BrdU incorporation rate (Figure 1 C and S2). Overall, these data showed that SEMA6D overexpression has variable e ﬀects in di ﬀerent cell lines that it induces proliferation in nontumorigenic MCF10A cells while reducing it in MCF7 cancer cells and showed no e ﬀect on MDA MB 231 cancer cells. SEMA6D Reduces Anchorage-Independent Growth Potential of Breast Cancer Cell Lines. Anchorage- independent growth is correlated with the tumorigenic potential of the cancer cells. Thus, we analyzed how SEMA6D a ﬀects anchorage-independent growth potential using soft agar assay.SEMA6D overexpression reduced the number of colonies formed in soft agar both for MCF7 and MDA MB 231 cells (Figure 1 D). Speci ﬁcally, the decrease was 48% for MCF7 and 26% for MDA MB 231 cells ( Figure 1 E). MCF10A cells did not form any colonies in either condition, indicating that SEMA6Doverexpression cannot induce tumorigenicity in the normal breast cells. On the contrary, SEMA6D reduces the tumorigenic potential of breast cancer cells. Figure 4. SEMA6D overexpression induces the expression of mesenchymal markers. (A) Ratio of mRNA expressions of mesenchymal (SNAI1, SNAI2, vimentin, and N-cadherin) and epithelial ( E-cadherin) markers in the SEMA6D overexpressing group compared to the LacZ overexpressing group are shown. The dashed line represents the relative expression level in the LacZ group. Data is represented as the mean ±SD of three independent experiments. (B) Representative Western blot images and (C) quanti ﬁcation of SNAI2 and N-cadherin protein levels are shown for the three cell lines that overexpress LacZ (gray) or SEMA6D (black). Data is represented as mean ±SD of two independent experiments.

Migration and invasion potential of the cancer cells are closely related to the aggressive phenotype of tumors. Thus, we analyzed whether SEMA6D has an e ﬀect on migration and invasion. Migration potential was assessed by wound healingassay, in which MCF10A and MCF7 cells that overexpress SEMA6D covered a larger area compared to the control cells 24 and 48 h after scratching, respectively ( Figure 2 A). The image analysis showed that SEMA6D overexpression reduced thepercentage of the open area to 53.2% in MCF10A cells compared to control cells, where the open area was 76.9% at 24 h (Figure 2 B). Similarly, in MCF7 cells that overexpress SEMA6D, open area was reduced to 68.4%, which was 77.7% in the control group at the end of 48 h ( Figure 2 B). Furthermore, SEMA6D overexpression changed the migrationpattern of MCF7 cells. We observed a higher number of scattered single cells dissociated from the wound border in the case of SEMA6D overexpression ( Figure 2 C). On average, there were 3.3, 5.3, and 11.3 dissociated cells in MCF7-SEMA6D compared to 2, 1.8, and 5.1 cells in the control MCF7-LacZ cells at 12, 24, and 48 h after scratching, respectively ( Figure 2 D). In MDA MB 231 cells, we did not observe any e ﬀect of SEMA6D overexpression on the migration potential or pattern of the cells (Figure 2 A and B). For the evaluation of the invasion, we used a three-channel lab-on-a-chip (LOC) system in which cells labeled with green ﬂuorescent dye invade through Matrigel loaded channel toward serum-rich medium. 17On each LOC, the Matrigel channel is separated from the cell channel by three gates, through which cells receive chemoattractant signals and invade Matrigel.Invasion of MDA MB 231 cells that overexpress LacZ or SEMA6D was observed for 3 days ( Figure 3 A). The distribution of the distance invaded by the cells that overexpress SEMA6Dwas shifted toward higher values compared to control cells that overexpress LacZ ( Figure 3 B). Moreover, SEMA6D over- expression increased the mean and the median distance invadedby the cells ( Figure 3 C). On the other hand, SEMA6D overexpression did not induce an invasive behavior in MCF7 and MCF10A cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that SEMA6D induces migration in the normal cell line MCF10A and the cancer cell line MCF7, whereas although it cannot trigger a migratory phenotype per se, SEMA6D can augment the invasivepotential of MDA MB 231 cancer cells.SEMA6D A ﬀects the Expression of Epithelial and Mesenchymal Markers. Increased migration rate in MCF10A and MCF7 cells, single-cell migratory pattern of MCF7 cells, and increased invasion of MDA MB 231 cells in response toSEMA6D overexpression point to a more mesenchymalphenotype. Thus, we analyzed the expression pattern ofepithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) markers to inves-tigate whether SEMA6D overexpression a ﬀects the EMT phenotype. In MCF10A cells, mRNA expression of mesen-chymal markers SNAI1, vimentin, and N-cadherin was increased, while mesenchymal marker SNAI2 and epithelialmarker E-cadherin was downregulated upon SEMA6D over- expression ( Figure 4 A). In the MCF7 cells that overexpress SEMA6D, mesenchymal marker N-cadherin was signi ﬁcantly reduced compared to control cells. Other than that, SEMA6Doverexpression did not signi ﬁcantly a ﬀect mRNA levels of the EMT markers in MCF7 and MDA MB 231 cells ( Figure 4 A). SNAI2 is one of the main regulators of EMT in breast cancer 21 and was previously shown to be correlated with SEMA6D in breast cancer;15thus, we analyzed SNAI2 protein (Slug) expression ( Figure 4 B). SEMA6D overexpression increased SNAI2 protein by 1.6- and 1.8-fold in MCF10A and MCF7 cells,respectively ( Figure 4 C). In MDA MB 231 cells, we did not observe any signi ﬁcant di ﬀerence in SNAI2 ( Figure 4 B,C). Overall, these results suggest that SEMA6D could induce a mesenchymal phenotype via upregulation of SNAI2 in epithelialMCF10A and MCF7 cells, while it has no e ﬀect on EMT in MDA MB 231 cells, which has a more mesenchymal phenotype,to begin with. Diﬀerential Expression of SEMA6D in Invasive Breast Carcinoma Is Coupled with Di ﬀerential Expression of Cell Cycle Regulators and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Markers in Human Breast Tumors. Finally, we analyzed whether the e ﬀects of SEMA6D overexpression we demonstrated in the cell lines had clinical relevance in breast cancer using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. For this purpose, we sorted all samples with respect to SEMA6Dexpression and selected the highest expressing quartile(SEMA6D-High, n= 273) and the lowest expressing quartile (SEMA6D-Low, n= 273) as subgroups. Compared to SEMA6D-Low samples, SEMA6D-High samples had 81%higher SEMA6D gene expression ( Figure S3A ). mRNA expressions of cell cycle-related genes were mostly down-regulated in the SEMA6D-High group compared to SEMA6D-Low samples ( Figure S3B , with the highest suppression in Figure 5. SEMA6D-High and SEMA6D-Low subgroups of invasive breast carcinoma are represented on gene-expression-based clusters. SEMA6D- High ( n= 273) and SEMA6D-Low ( n= 273) samples are represented on reduced dimension plots based on expressions of the cell cycle, epithelial- mesenchymal transition, and Notch pathway-related genes.ACS Omega http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf Article https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c00840 ACS Omega 2022, 7, 15769 −1577815775CCNE1 ( −25.9%, p< 0.001)). The UMAP algorithm reduced the dimension of cell cycle genes in six clusters based onexpressions ( Figure S3C ). Comparisons based on SEMA6D expression status demon- strated a clear distinction between SEMA6D-High andSEMA6D-Low samples, with downregulation of E2F1, E2F2,CDC20, CCNB1, CCNB2, CDC25A, PCNA, CDK1,CDC25C, CDC6, CCNE1, and CDC25B in the SEMA6D-High group (cut of scores >0.4, sorted from highest to lowestscore) ( Figure 5 ). Genes related to EMT were also a ﬀected by the SEMA6D status ( Figure S3B ). CDH1 ( −5%) and SNAI1 (−4%) expressions were signi ﬁcantly lower in SEMA6D-High samples, while the remaining EMT markers showed signi ﬁcantly higher expressions. The UMAP algorithm detected nine clustersfor EMT marker genes ( Figure S3D ). Still, once this dimensionally reduced expression data was strati ﬁed based on SEMA6D status, SEMA6D-Low samples showed a clearseparation from the SEMA6D-High group based on down-regulation of ZEB1, ZEB2, and SNAI2 genes with cuto ﬀvalues of 0.95, 0.58, and 0.44, respectively ( Figure 5 ). Notch signaling is one of the signaling pathways that is deregulated in breast tumorigenesis. We and others have shownthat in addition to a ﬀecting proliferation and transformation, Notch activation also induces EMT in breast tissue. 17Thus, we later asked whether SEMA6D status is associated with Notchsignaling. The majority of the genes related to Notch signalingwere signi ﬁcantly upregulated in SEMA6D-High samples, except DLL3, which had a 47% ( p< 0.001) reduction ( Figure S3B). UMAP dimensional reduction identi ﬁed seven clusters (Figure S3E ); however, strati ﬁcation based on SEMA6D status showed a distinction based on NOTCH4 and DLL4upregulation, with the cuto ﬀvalues of 0.94 and 0.53, in SEMA6D-High samples ( Figure 5 ). Next, we analyzed whether Notch signaling activity might be involved in SEMA6Dregulation via activating the pathway upon overexpression ofNotch1 intracellular domain (NICD) in MCF10A cells.SEMA6D mRNA ( Figure S4A ) and protein ( Figure S4B and C) expressions were upregulated in response to Notch activation suggesting the Notch pathway as a potential upstream regulatorof SEMA6D. ■DISCUSSION The greater part of the research on SEMA6D investigated its rolein developmental processes, while the comparatively smallnumber of studies explored whether and how SEMA6D isinvolved in tumorigenesis. Speci ﬁcally, the two studies focusing on SEMA6D in breast cancer are limited to the analysis ofexpression and mutation data of breast cancer patients and su ﬀer from the lack of experimental evidence. 15,16Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a better understanding of how SEMA6Daﬀects the molecular and cellular properties of normal breast and breast cancer cell lines. First, we investigated the e ﬀect of SEMA6D overexpression on proliferation. Prior studies have not established a consistentassociation between SEMA6D and proliferation. In di ﬀerent regions of the developing heart, SEMA6D was shown to regulate the migration of mesenchymal and endothelial cells but had no eﬀect on the proliferation. 5,8On the other hand, a more recent study noted that proliferation of prenatal cardiomyocytes wasreduced in SEMA6D knockout mouse model, which also hadless Cyclin D1 and Cyclin D2 levels. 7In line with this result, SEMA6D overexpression was reported to induce proliferation inosteosarcoma cell line HOS, which contributes to its oncogenicrole.9In accordance with the previous observations, our results also demonstrate a cell-speci ﬁceﬀect of SEMA6D on the proliferation of breast cells. SEMA6D overexpression inducedproliferation in the normal breast cell line, MCF10A, hinting at atumor-initiating role. However, the inability to induceanchorage-independent growth of MCF10A cells indicates that SEMA6D per se could not act as a strong oncogene activating these two traits simultaneously in nontumorigenicbreast cells. On the other hand, SEMA6D overexpressionreduced proliferation in MCF7 cells, illustrating an antitumori-genic role, which is also supported by reduced anchorage-independent growth of both breast cancer cell lines. Our resultsdiﬀer from the positive correlation demonstrated between SEMA6D expression and anchorage-independent growth inmalignant mesothelioma and osteosarcoma cells 9,11highlighting the importance of tissue and cell context in tumorigenesis. In accordance with the experimental data, TCGA analysis revealedan association between SEMA6D levels (high vs low) and theexpression of cell cycle-related genes. Although CCND2 andCCND1 were among the upregulated genes in the SEMA6D-High subpopulation, the majority of the positive regulators ofthe cell cycle, including CCNE1, CDC25C, CDC20, E2F1, andE2F2, were downregulated at a greater magnitude, which mightreﬂect the growth-inhibitory e ﬀect of SEMA6D in MCF7 cells. Whether increased proliferation due to SEMA6D over- expression observed in MCF10A cells represents an early stage of breast tumorigenesis remains unknown due to the lackof relevant clinical sample group in the data set. A number of studies described a link between SEMA6D and migration mainly during embryonic development. SEMA6D was demonstrated as an essential molecule involved in cardiac development and neural tube closure, during which its majoreﬀect was on the migration of mesenchymal and endothelial cells. 8Likewise, BMP-induced migration during atrioventricular cushion development was dependent on SEMA6D upregula-tion.5SEMA6D was reported as a repulsive regulator for dorsal root ganglion, the crossing of retinal ganglion cells, andpericyte −endothelial cell interaction, all of which are related to migratory behavior of cells.3,22A recent study that focused on osteosarcoma noted that SEMA6D overexpression rescued the migration and invasion potential, which was decreased in response to knockdown of cicUBAP2, a positive regulator ofSEMA6D expression.10Here, we showed that SEMA6D induces migration in MCF10A and MCF7 cell lines but does not a ﬀect MDA MB 231 cells. Considering that the latter could beexplained by the extensively migratory nature, we also analyzedinvasion and demonstrated that SEMA6D promoted theinvasion potential of MDA MB 231 cells. Together, in additionto con ﬁrming the previous ﬁndings, these results presented the ﬁrst evidence that in breast cells, SEMA6D can promote migration and invasion. Although SEMA6D was implicated in migration in the context of development and cancer, its role in EMT, which is related tothe migratory phenotype, has not been investigated thoroughly.In breast cancer, TCGA analysis showed that the SEMA6D-high patient group has decreased E-cadherin and increased SNAI2, ZEB1, and ZEB2, suggesting a correlation between SEMA6Dand mesenchymal transition. 15In gastric cancer, colocalization of SEMA6D with SNAI1 protein (Snail) was positivelycorrelated with invasion and lymph node metastasis.23Here, we showed that SEMA6D regulated mRNA expression of theEMT markers, mainly shifting toward a more mesenchymalpattern in MCF10A cells. On the other hand, in breast cancerACS Omega http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf Article https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c00840 ACS Omega 2022, 7, 15769 −1577815776cells, there was no change in the mRNA levels of EMT markers other than a decrease in N-cadherin in MCF7, which was not anticipated considering the shift toward a more migratory andinvasive phenotype in response to SEMA6D overexpression. Onthe other hand, SNAI2 (Slug) protein was increased in MCF7cells, consistent with a more mesenchymal phenotype. Supporting the experimental data, SEMA6D levels were associated with the expression of EMT markers in the TCGAdata set. Consistent with the previous study, 15in the SEMA6D- High group mesenchymal markers, including ZEB1, SNAI2,ZEB2, and TWIST, were increased. Collectively, the data wepresent here suggest a correlation between SEMA6D expressionand a migratory/invasive phenotype supported by a mesen-chymal shift in the EMT markers ’expression, which are in accordance with the previous studies. Although both ourexperimental data and TCGA data analyzed by us and others converge on SNAI2 in focus, the existing data fail to provide clear evidence of a direct transcriptional and translationalregulation of EMT by SEMA6D. SEMA6D induced a similar trend in breast cancer cell lines, such as a decrease in anchorage-independent growth and anincrease in mobility. However, the two cell lines showed distinct phenotypes in migration and expression pro ﬁle of EMT markers. Although the cell lines used in this study represent thecharacteristic properties of luminal (MCF7) and basal (MDAMB 231) breast cancer subtypes, the data cannot be extrapolatedto subtype-speci ﬁc roles of SEMA6D. This issue needs to be explored in further research using a panel of cell linesrepresenting di ﬀerent subtypes. Finally, we showed an association between Notch pathway- related genes and SEMA6D levels in the TCGA data set andinduction of SEMA6D expression upon Notch activation inMCF10A cells. Although our data suggest that Notch signalingmight be an upstream regulator of SEMA6D in the breast, thefunctional importance of Notch-SEMA6D relation in breasttumorigenesis remains to be answered. In summary, here, we showed a cell-speci ﬁceﬀect of SEMA6D in normal and tumorigenic cell lines of the breast. A possibleexplanation for this observation is the di ﬀerent downstream mechanisms activated upon SEMA6D overexpression in di ﬀer- ent cell lines. A notable example in this context comes fromosteosarcoma, where only two out of four cell lines had increasedERK phosphorylation to di ﬀerent extents upon SEMA6D overexpression. 9Although Plexin A1 was reported as the receptor of SEMA6D, other cell-surface proteins such asvascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), O ﬀ- Track (OTK), Ng-CAM related cell adhesion molecule (Nr-CAM), and Plexin A4 were also shown to interact withSEMA6D. 2,3,8,11Thus, di ﬀerential representation of SEMA6D interacting proteins on the cell surface could also explain cell-speci ﬁceﬀects that we observed. Another reason for the cell- speci ﬁceﬀect could be the endogenous expression pro ﬁle of SEMA6D. Although we observed a single band in the conditioned media, di ﬀerent bands of SEMA6D were visible in whole cell lysates of each cell line, which might indicatedistinct endogenous SEMA6D isoforms. As SEMA6D has nineisoforms, 6,24we cannot exclude the possibility of SEMA6D overexpression interfering with endogenous SEMA6D isoformsand contributing to the manifestation of di ﬀerent phenotypes. Although the issue of di ﬀerent isoforms is an intriguing one, to date there is no data on the functional importance of di ﬀerent SEMA6D isoforms in breast cancer, and it requires furtherresearch.In this study, we provided the ﬁrst experimental evidence on the functional role of SEMA6D in normal and tumorigenicbreast cell lines. However, there is an abundant room for furtherinvestigations to answer the questions such as interactingpartners on the cell surface, upstream regulators, and down-stream mediators of SEMA6D to develop a full picture ofSEMA6D ’s role in breast cancer. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT *sıSupporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.2c00840 .

Day 0  Thaw/prepare the hydrogel according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ex: “matrigel ... by  submerging the vial in ice in a 4°C refrigerator, in t he back, overnight.” (i.e. Day -1)  Load the middle channel with the hydrogel. Ex: Matrigel diluted with M0 to  4mg/ml. Pipet  20 µl  of hydrogel , load 10 µl per one middle channel.   The hydrogel can also include cells or other agents that is expected to affect invasion and  chemotaxis.   Rack the  hydrogel loaded  IC-chips into a staining jar containing 5 ml of sterile H 20 and place the  jar into a cell culture incubator for 30 minutes.    2023 -04-23  Page 2 of 5     Water provides humidity to prevent drying of the hydrogel.   Passage cells and resuspend at 1 Million cells/ml in M0.  * Optimal cell density can be different for different cell types and should be optimized  accordingly.   Load the bottom channel with ~15 µl of MC.   Load the top channel with ~15 µl of cells in M0.   Rack the fully loaded IC -chips into a staining jar with bottom channels at the bottom and place  the jar into a cell culture incubat or.  After 1 -2 hours, acquire Day0 images using a fluorescent microscope.   Day0 images are useful  because they serve as reference images for quantifying invasion and  migration.   Alternatively, if cells were not labeled, label nuclei using ex: DAPI, at Day 3 f or quantification  of  invasion and chemotaxis .  For drug applications, incubate loaded IC -chips in culture for at least 24 hours  before adding  drugs to the system .  Day 1  Inspect cells under a fluorescent microscope and capture images if desired.   Change the medium in the bottom and top channels to MC+drug and M0+drug, respectively.  If  no drug is to be tested, simply change medium.   It is recommended that medium is placed at one inlet of the bottom or top channels and is  slowly withdrawn from the othe r inlet of the bottom or top channels . Repeat once to ensure  complete change of medium.   Depending on the cell type, medium in the bottom and top channels can be changed every day  or every other day.   Day 2  Acquire Day2 images using a fluorescent microscope if desired.   Time point is 24 hours after drug addition.   Day 3  Acquire Day3 images using a fluorescent microscope.   Time point is 48 hours after drug addition.   Alternatively, if cells were not labeled, label nuclei using ex: DAPI, at Day 3 for quantification  of  invasion and chemotaxis .    TIPS & TRICKS    2023 -04-23  Page 3 of 5     Use a P20 micropipet to minimize pressure while loading channels.     If you realize a leak while loading the gel (with or without cells) into the middle channel, stop and  load the rest of the gel from the other inl et.    Holding the chip upright such that the longest axis is perpendicular to the ground can help, too.  Otherwise holding the chip flat is also fine, depends on the viscosity of the gel you loading.     Inspect the IC -chip under the microscope to check for com plete filling of the middle channel with  the gel. If the gel does not fill the inter -post gaps fully*, make sure the gel reaches the top of the  outlet before stopping loading.     *The gel should fill in the middle channel such that the gel reaches the long b ottom of the posts  facing the media channels.     When changing media in the top and bottom channels, beware of air bubbles trapped in the  inlets. If there is air, gently remove the air first then load new media. If there is no air, you should  see the media m ove as you touch the media from one inlet/outlet.     When changing media, place a 20 ul drop at an inlet then aspirate 20 ul** from the other inlet,  i.e. instead of pushing new media in, pull out old media which will be replaced by the new (drop)  media place d at one of the inlets.     ** Aspirate less if there has been evaporation to avoid generation of air bubbles.     When changing media, repeat change once (total 2 aspirations).   Change media every other day unless cells are metabolically very active, if so , chan ge media  every day.       2023 -04-23  Page 4 of 5     USEFUL SHORT VIDEOS   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=562Mt2KiNuI  IC-chip 1/3   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtifpIWERw0  IC-chip 2/3   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtuNWjjjZP0  IC-chip 3/3   https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=8Ip_ZJ0z -Tk DDI-chip    SCHEMATIC OF LOADING OF IC-CHIP FOR ASSESSING CHEMOTAXIS AND  INVASION         2023 -04-23  Page 5 of 5       #chemotactic  invasion of #cancer  cells in #ICcellchip  @initiocell .

Ex: “matrigel ... by  submerging the vial in ice in a 4°C refrigerator, in the back, overnight.” (i.e. Da y 0)  Mix cells and hydrogel at appropriate rati os for example 1:1 for matrigel. The final concentration  of cells will depend on the type of cell used yet 6 Million cells / ml as final cell concentration is a  good starting point. Use 20 µl of the mix  per on e middle channel.  For precious e.g. patient  samples, 10 µl of the mix can suffice.  Otherwise, working with a P20 adjusted to a 20 µl volume  for all channels facilitates loading of the DDI -chip.    2019011 8  Page 2 of 4     Load the middle channel from the “wide” end so that the pressu re applied is enough to fill the  wide part and the rest of the middle channel. Holding the chip upright while loading also hel ps.  A P20 micropipette  is ideal for loading.  Using larger volume micropipettes will increase pressure  and will not provide proper control of loading.   Place  the hydrogel -cell mix  loaded  DDI-chips in a petri dish  containing pieces of filter paper  wetted with  sterile H 20 and place the petri into a cell  culture incubator for 30 minutes.   If cells tend to settle at the glass bottom, 15 minutes’  incubation on PDMS side and 15 minutes  incubation on the glass side is recommended. Please note PDMS will stick to the petri surface  so place spacers when incubatin g on the PDMS side.   Water provides humidity to prevent drying of the hydrogel.   Prepare hydrogel mix with the same final concentration ex: 1:1 using medium without cells and  load the side channels with this mix. Use 10 µl of the mix per one side channel.   Holding the chip upright while loading helps.   Place the cell-free hydrogel loaded DDI-chips in a petri dish containing pieces of filter paper  wetted with sterile H20 and place the petri into a cell culture incubator for 30 minutes.   Load medium to the mediu m channels.  Use 10 µl medium per one medium channel.   When loading medium, hold the DDI -chip horizontal such that the inlet and outlet of the medium  channel to be loaded are facing upwards to allow air to be push ed out.  If cells can survive in serum free me dium , it is better to use it than complete medium to avoid  influence of supplements on cell -cell interactions.  Alternatively, medium with reduced serum  concentration can be used.   After 1 -2 hours, acquire reference  images using a phase contrast and/or  a fluorescent  microscope.   Reference  images are essential because they serve as reference images for quantifying multi - cellular organization .  For drug applications, incubate loaded chips in culture for at least 24 hours  before adding drugs  to the system  to allow cells to accommodate to the microenvironment .  Day 2  Inspect cells under a phase contrast and/or fluorescent microscope and capture images if  desired.   Change the medium in the medium  channels to contain medium+drug . If no drug is to be tested,  simply change medium.   It is recommended that medium is placed at one inlet of the bottom or top channels and is  slowly withdrawn from the other inlet of the bottom or top channels . Repeat once to ensure  complete change of mediu m.  Day 3 and afterwards    2019011 8  Page 3 of 4     Acquire images using a phase contrast and/or fluorescent microscope at desired  time points .    TIPS & TRICKS   Use a P20 micropipet to minimize pressure while loading channels.     If you realize a leak while loading the gel (with or without cells) into a channel, stop and load the  rest of the gel from the other inlet.
