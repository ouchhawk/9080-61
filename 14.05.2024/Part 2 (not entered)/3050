    mCon1/JFHRluc2(j5.1; adapted)    Virus Specifications:    Description:   mCon1/JFHRluc2(j5.1; adapted) is a genotype 1b/2a chimeric reporter virus in which the HCV IRES drives translation of a  Renilla  luciferase-containing HCV polyprotein that is cleaved by cellular and viral proteases to produce the individual HCV  proteins.  The Renilla  luciferase is fused C-terminal to the p7-NS2 cl eavage site, and is cleaved from the HCV polyprotein  by virtue its fusion with the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2a peptide coding sequence (FMDV2a).  This virus contains five  adaptive mutations that were identified after passaging the parental virus in cell culture to generate a variant that produces  high titers.        Genotype: 1b/2a   Strains: Con1—core through the N-terminal region of NS2  JFH1--5’NTR; N-terminal region of NS2 to NS5B  J6--3’NTR1  Location of chimeric junction: between the first and second predicted transmembrane domains of NS22     Reporter: Renilla  luciferase   Configuration:  monocistronic  Reporter location: C-terminal to the p7-NS2 junction  Adaptive mutations: one within the Con1 region of NS2, one within the JFH1 region of NS2, one within NS3, two within  NS5A3; adaptive mutations are indicated in the above figure with an asterisk.  Maximal titer range:  low 103 to low 104 TCID 50/ml    Time point post-electroporation at wh ich maximal titers are achieved:  48 hours   Plasmid designation: APP152  Virus designation: APV152     Virus Production:    Description:  Due to the error-prone nature of the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, it is recommended that stocks  be generated from in vitro  transcribed (IVT) RNA generated from the cloned viral genome.  Virus is produced following  electroporation of IVT RNA into the highly permissive human hepatoma cell line Huh7.5.  The Huh7.5 cell line was  generated by curing a stably selected replicon-containing cell line 4, and are the industry-standard for the production of high  titer culture-produced HCV.

Apath Corporate Profile Home Company Technology Licensing Compound Screening Hepatitis C Virus Technology Negative Strand Virus Technology News Careers Categories Company Profile Management Team Company History Contact Us Telephone General Information (347) 533-4831 Postal Address 1173A Second Avenue Suite 355 New York, NY 10065 Business Development Robert Roth (347) 533-4831 Company Company Profile Apath is a privately held technology licensing company engaged in the commercial application of virology and viral genetics to assist pharmaceutical companies in discovering and developing therapeutic products for the treatment of viral infections. The current focus of Apath is on hepatitis C virus (HCV). The company also works with other RNA viruses that are human pathogens, including Influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses. The worldwide market for antiviral drugs is estimated to be approximately $20 billion and it is expected to grow rapidly as new therapies become available. In 1990 there were just five licensed antiviral drugs; today there are more than sixty. Most of these drugs, however, are for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and various herpesviruses. Most human viruses are RNA viruses. There is an urgent need for drugs to treat the numerous viral diseases caused by RNA viruses for which limited or no therapeutic options are currently available. While virtually all major pharmaceutical companies have antiviral discovery programs for HIV and HCV, very limited drug discovery activity is being devoted to other viral pathogens. Apath was founded in St. Louis, Missouri, by Charles M. Rice, Ph.D., then Professor of Molecular Microbiology at Washington University School of Medicine. Dr. Rice and key Apath employees have a proven track record and comprehensive expertise in virology and molecular biology. Apath has key patent estates, proprietary know-how, and license agreements related to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and other important human viral pathogens including methods to detect viruses. Our expertise, proprietary tools and relationships with leading virologists enable us to provide researchers with the tools that they need to tap into the antiviral drug market. Mannagement Team Charles M. Rice, Ph.D. - Founder and Managing Director Dr. Rice is the Maurice R. and Corinne P. Greenberg Professor of the Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease at The Rockefeller University in New York and the Scientific and Executive Director of the Tri-Institutional Center for the Study of Hepatitis C. He was a member of the faculty at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis from 1986 to 2000 as a Professor of Molecular Microbiology. Dr. Rice received his B.A. in Zoology from the University of California in 1974, and his Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the California Institute of Technology in 1981. Dr. Rice is an expert in RNA viruses and his group in New York is among the world's leaders in the molecular biology of hepatitis C virus. Dr. Rice has published over two hundred original research publications in peer-reviewed journals and numerous review articles and book chapters. Dr. Rice is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences and a consultant or board member of multiple pharmaceutical companies. He holds numerous U.S. and Global patents related to hepatitis C virus molecular biology. Robert M. Roth - Vice President, Strategic Operations Mr. Roth joined Apath,LLC in 1999. He has over fourteen years of experience in developing high throughput screening systems, integrated robotics platforms and laboratory management systems with successful biotechnology companies, including Genome Systems, Incyte Genomics and Apath,LLC. He received his Bachelors of Science, in Biochemistry, and a Masters of Science, in Health Sciences from Washington University in Saint Louis. Mr. Roth holds multiple U.S. and Global patents related to inventions in the field of antiviral drug discovery.

Under the agreement, Southern Research conducts laboratory testing, research, and/or screening of potential therapeutic agents for HCV on an exclusive, fee-for-service basis using Apath’s HCV virus-based technology, HCVcc. Most preclinical drug screenings for new HCV therapies use cell lines that harbor replicons—intracellular sub-genomic, self-replicating RNA molecules that contain the nucleotide sequences required for RNA replication, transcription, and translation, but are not themselves infectious. Using a virus-based system, researchers can now develop antiviral treatments targeting viral entry into the cell, all of the replication machinery of the replicon, as well as downstream events such as viral assembly and release from the cell. As such, the entire viral life cycle is available for drug discovery and development. Southern Research conducts both contract research and basic research for clients, providing preclinical drug discovery, development and clinical trial support services in cancer, infectious diseases, and CNS/neurological disease to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Scientists conduct translational science to invent small molecules and advance them from the design stage to the clinic. Services available include medicinal chemistry, molecular biology, biochemistry, high-throughput screening and a full set of in-house GLP development services including toxicology, ADME/PK, animal models, formulations, and bioanalytical services.

The virus is transmitted by the transfer of body fluids (primarily blood) from infected individuals. Those who abuse intravenous drugs, those who received blood transfusions prior to 1992, and health-care workers, account for the majority of infected patients. The level of morbidity and mortality associated with HCV is high. The majority of infected patients remain infected for life and a significant percentage of HCV-infected patients ultimately progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer). HCV infection has become the major reason for liver transplantation in the U.S. An estimated 3.9 million Americans are chronically infected with Hepatitis C. This is four times the number of those estimated to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). One out of every 50 Americans is infected with HCV and 75% of those individuals do not realize they are infected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates the U.S averages 18,000 new infections annually in addition to approximately 12,000 deaths caused by HCV. Unlike hepatitis A and B, no vaccine exists to prevent HCV infection. The best available treatment is a combination of two broad-spectrum antiviral agents, interferon and ribavirin, with one of two available direct-acting antivirals targeting the HCV serine protease. This therapy does not provide broad cross-genotype coverage and is associated with serious side effects. The hepatitis C virus drug market is experiencing a dramatic growth and is expected to exceed $15 Billion USD in 2020. This robust growth will be driven primarily by the launch of novel premium priced therapeutics that will increase the cure rate, minimize side effects and drive treatment of an increasing fraction of those infected. Similar to HIV, HCV has a high predeliction to develop resistance to antiviral drugs. It is expected, therefore, that multi-drug “cocktail” therapies, used in different combinations will be necessary to effectively manage chronic HCV infection. This suggests that the HCV market will be served by numerous therapeutic agents. Apath can assist clients in developing innovative HCV therapeutics by providing them with access to state-of-the-art anti-HCV development platforms, technological know-how and extensive HCV research experience. 3'NTR Infectious Clone Technology - Replicons The 3' non-translated region (3'NTR) is the most conserved region of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome (Kolykhalov et al. 1996. J. Virology 70: 3363-71 & Blight et al. 1997. J. Virology 71:7345-52). It is likely to be a critical regulatory region and it has been shown to be required for replication of an infectious clone of HCV in chimpanzees (Kolykhalov et al.1997, Science 277:570-74). The 3' NTR is, therefore, an excellent genomic (RNA) target for an anti-HCV therapy. U.S. 5,874,565 (and related EP 0856051) was assigned to Washington University and licensed exclusively to Apath. Identification of well-defined and robust cell-culture systems for HCV is critical for identification and evaluation of antivirals against HCV. In 1999, Lohmann et al. described a subgenomic HCV replicon constructed from genotype 1b RNA, and isolated a Huh-7 cell line which contains this autonomously replicating replicon (Lohmann et al. 1999. Science 285:110-13). The replicon system was further enhanced by the discovery of adaptive mutations which allowed more robust replication of the viral RNA in cell culture (Blight et al. 2000. Science 290:1972-74). Replicon technology was expanded to include genotype 1a RNA and respective adaptive mutations (Blight et al. 2003. J. Virology 77:3181-90) as well as genotype 2a RNA (Kato et al. 2003. Gastroenterology 125: 1808-17) . Highly Permissive Cell Line Technology While studying replicon cells, it was discovered that replication efficiency was impacted by the state of the host cells. Researchers attempted to identify host cells that had adapted to viral replication to improve efficacy of the cell culture systems. Huh-7.5 cells are a human hepatocyte cell line generated by curing a stably selected HCV replicon-containing Huh \- 7 cell line with IFN (Blight et al. 2002. J Virology 76: 13001-14). Taking that strategy one step further, researchers at the Scripps Institute cured a stably selected HCV replicon-containing Huh \- 7.5 cell line with IFN, which resulted in the human hepatocyte cell line Huh \- 7.5.1 cells (Zhong et al. 2005. PNAS 102:9294-99). HCV Full Virus Life Cycle Technology - HCVcc The first full length viral RNA that was capable of replicating in cell culture and producing infectious virus particles was the JFH-1 sequence. This HCV genotype 2a RNA was developed in the laboratory of Dr. Takaji Wakita at Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Neuroscience (Wakita et al. 2005. Nat Med. 11: 791-96). In efforts to improve viral titers, chimeric genomes were constructed with sequences of a second genotype 2a sequence, J6. This nucleic acid sequence was shown to be infectious in chimpanzees (Yanagi et al. 1999. Virology 262: 250-63) and was discovered by the group of Dr. Robert H. Purcell at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. J6/JFH was one successful chimeric 2a genome that replicates and produces virus particles that are infectious in cell culture. J6/JFH was developed in the laboratory of Dr. Charles M. Rice at The Rockefeller University (Lindenbach et al. 2005. Science 309:623-26). Another full-length 2a chimera with a different intragenotypic breakpoint, Jc1, was developed in the laboratory of Dr. Ralf Bartenschlager at The University of Heidelberg (Pietschmann et al. 2006. PNAS 103: 7408-13). To expand HCV infectious culture systems to other HCV genotypes, chimeric genomes were constructed. Core-NS2 recombinants are JFH1-based recombinant genomes containing Core, envelope protein 1 and 2 (E1, E2), p7, and nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) from other HCV genotypes. Apath has developed these chimeras using Core-NS2 of genotypes 1a or 1b. An expanded panel of JFH1-based intergenotypic chimeras containing Core-NS2 of genotypes 1 to 7 was developed in the laboratory of Dr. Jens Bukh at Copenhagen University Hospital (Gottwein et al. 2009. Hepatology 49: 364-77 & Gottwein et al. 2011. J. Virology 85: 8913-28). NS5A chimeras were also developed in the laboratory of Dr. Jens Bukh. These JFH1-based recombinant infectious cell culture systems express NS5A of genotypes 1 to 7 (Scheel et al. 2011. Gastroenterology 140: 1032-42 ) .

RSV is the primary cause of bronchopneumonia in infants and children in the U.S., and results in approximately 100,000 hospitalizations and 4,000 deaths each year. Premature infants, immunodeficient patients, and the institutionalized elderly are at the greatest risk for significant morbidity and mortality from RSV. Current treatments for RSV are suboptimal. Inhaled ribavirin is difficult to administer, relatively toxic, and, as a result, infrequently used. A prophylactically-administrated monoclonal antibody (Synagis, MedImmune) is available for high-risk patients. The pipeline of potential new therapies for RSV is limited and consists of a small number of drugs in pre-clinical through Phase III development. RSV vaccines are under development, but are not likely to eliminate the need for therapeutic agents given the immunocompromised nature of those most at risk. In an agreement with Washington University in St Louis, Rush University Medical Center and the National Institutes of Health Public Health Services, Apath has exclusively in-licensed the rights to U.S. Patent No. 7585667 issued September 8, 2009. This patented technology is available to be licensed non-exclusively to interested third parties. All research and development tangible property materials will be provided to our clients via a purchases services agreement from Dr. Mark Peeples, formerly a professor at Rush University, currently a professor at Ohio State University, Children’s Nationwide Hospital. Dr. Peeples has developed and validated multiple cell based respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replicons. More recently, he has added the Renilla Luciferase gene to the RSV replicon in order to provide an easily quantifiable marker for High Throughput Screening. Please contact Robert Roth for additional information and licensing opportunities related to Negative Strand RNA Virus Replicon Technology. Negative Strand RNA Virus Detection The vast majority of human viral pathogens are RNA viruses. There is a critical medical need to develop effective therapies for a large number of these viral pathogens. Among these are: • Other respiratory viruses (parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, rhinoviruses, hantaviruses) • Enteric viruses (enteroviruses, rotavirus, caliciviruses, etc.) • Encephalitis-causing viruses (West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis, etc.) • Hemorrhagic fever viruses (Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, etc.) These viruses are not currently receiving significant research emphasis by the drug-discovery industry. Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc, a Quidel company, under an exclusive diagnostic sublicense from Apath is developing cell-based methods to detect RNA viruses of many families. This patented technology is based on RNA virus replicons and minigenomes and virus-dependent expression of reporter genes. This technology is being developed into assays for diagnosis of viral infections, for the identification of resistance to antivirals, and as an enabling tool in the discovery of new antiviral drugs.
